Here we demonstrate that systematic machine learning of the wave function can reduce this complexity to a tractable computational form, for some notable cases of physical interest. We introduce a variational representation of quantum states based on artificial neural networks with variable number of hidden neurons. A reinforcement-learning scheme is then demonstrated, capable of either finding the ground-state or describing the unitary time evolution of complex interacting quantum systems. We show that this approach achieves very high accuracy in the description of equilibrium and dynamical properties of prototypical interacting spins models in both one and two dimensions, thus offering a new powerful tool to solve the quantum many-body problem.},

The first three chapters contain introductory material culminating in a thorough discussion of the Hartree-Fock approximation.The remaining four chapters describe a variety of more sophisticated approaches, which improve upon this approximation.Among the highlights of the seven chapters are (1) a review of the mathematics (mostly matrix algebra) required for the rest of the book, (2) an introduction to the basic techniques, ideas, and notations of quantum chemistry, (3) a thorough discussion of the Hartree-Fock approximation, (4) a treatment of configuration interaction (Cl) and approaches incorporating electron correlation, (5) a description of the independent electron pair approximation and a variety of more sophisticated approaches that incorporate coupling between pairs, (6) a consideration of the perturbative approach to the calculation of the correlation energy of many-electron systems and (7) a brief introduction to the use of the one-particle many-body Green's function in quantum chemistry.Over 150 exercises, designed to help the reader acquire a working knowledge of the material, are embedded in the text. The book is largely self-contained and requires no prerequisite other than a solid undergraduate physical chemistry course; however, some exposure to quantum chemistry will enhance the student's appreciation of the material. Clear and well-written, this text is ideal for the second semester of a two-semester course in quantum chemistry, or for a special topics course.},

	abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

We describe a method for obtaining the numerically exact eigenenergies and eigenstates for such a model, along with the energies obtained through the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation. The exact solution is accessible with elementary mathematics, though numerical solutions are required. We also find that the WKB approximation is remarkably accurate, not just for the ground state, but for the excited states as well.},

We consider a wide range of both electron number, N?20, and electron gas parameter, rs?18, using the diffusion quantum Monte Carlo technique. Features associated with correlation appear to develop very differently in quantum dots than in bulk. The main reason is that translational symmetry is necessarily broken in a dot, leading to density modulation and inhomogeneity. Electron-electron interactions act to enhance this modulation ultimately leading to localization. This process appears to be completely smooth and occurs over a wide range of density. Thus there is a broad regime of {\textquotedblleft}incipient{\textquotedblright} Wigner crystallization in these quantum dots. Our specific conclusions are (i) the density develops sharp rings while the pair density shows both radial and angular inhomogeneity; (ii) the spin of the ground state is consistent with Hund{\textquoteright}s (first) rule throughout our entire range of rs for all 4?N?20; (iii) the addition energy curve first becomes smoother as interactions strengthen{\textemdash}the mesoscopic fluctuations are damped by correlation{\textemdash}and then starts to show features characteristic of the classical addition energy; (iv) localization effects are stronger for a smaller number of electrons; (v) finally, the gap to certain spin excitations becomes small at the strong interaction (large rs) side of our regime.},

	abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) is one of the most exciting and dynamic areas of modern research and application. The purpose of this review is to provide an introduction to the core concepts and tools of machine learning in a manner easily understood and intuitive to physicists. The review begins by covering fundamental concepts in ML and modern statistics such as the bias-variance tradeoff, overfitting, regularization, generalization, and gradient descent before moving on to more advanced topics in both supervised and unsupervised learning. Topics covered in the review include ensemble models, deep learning and neural networks, clustering and data visualization, energy-based models (including MaxEnt models and Restricted Boltzmann Machines), and variational methods. Throughout, we emphasize the many natural connections between ML and statistical physics. A notable aspect of the review is the use of Python Jupyter notebooks to introduce modern ML/statistical packages to readers using physics-inspired datasets (the Ising Model and Monte-Carlo simulations of supersymmetric decays of proton-proton collisions). We conclude with an extended outlook discussing possible uses of machine learning for furthering our understanding of the physical world as well as open problems in ML where physicists may be able to contribute.

	abstract = {Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is an advanced simulation methodology for studies of manybody quantum systems. In this review, we focus on the electronic structure QMC, i.e., methods relevant for systems described by the electron-ion Hamiltonians. Some of the key QMC achievements include direct treatment of electron correlation, accuracy in predicting energy differences and favorable scaling in the system size. Calculations of atoms, molecules, clusters and solids have demonstrated QMC applicability to real systems with hundreds of electrons while providing 90-95\% of the correlation energy and energy differences typically within a few percent of experiments. Advances in accuracy beyond these limits are hampered by the so-called fixed-node approximation which is used to circumvent the notorious fermion sign problem. Many-body nodes of fermion states and their properties have therefore become one of the important topics for further progress in predictive power and efficiency of QMC calculations. Some of our recent results on the wave function nodes and related nodal domain topologies will be briefly reviewed. This includes analysis of few-electron systems and descriptions of exact and approximate nodes using transformations and projections of the highly-dimensional nodal hypersurfaces into the 3D space. Studies of fermion nodes offer new insights into topological properties of eigenstates such as explicit demonstrations that generic fermionic ground states exhibit the minimal number of two nodal domains. Recently proposed trial wave functions based on Pfaffians with pairing orbitals are presented and their nodal properties are tested in calculations of first row atoms and molecules. Finally, backflow "dressed" coordinates are introduced as another possibility for capturing correlation effects and for decreasing the fixed-node bias.},

Monte Carlo calculations is often complicated, both due to specific correlations
and/or the fact that the analytical form of the trial wave function is difficult to
obtain. Our Boltzmann machine trial wave function can easily be used as start-

	abstract = {The Stochastic Gradient Approximation (SGA) is the natural extension of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods to the variational optimization of quantum wave function parameters. While many deterministic applications impose stochasticity, the SGA fruitfully takes advantage of the natural stochasticity already present in QMC in order to utilize a small number of QMC samples and approach the minimum more quickly by averaging out the random noise in the samples. The increasing efficiency of the method for systems with larger numbers of particles, and its nearly ideal scaling when running on parallelized processors, is evidence that the SGA is well suited for the study of nanoclusters. In this thesis, I discuss the SGA algorithm in detail. I also describe its application to both quantum dots, and to the Resonating Valence Bond wave function (RVB). The RVB is a sophisticated model of electronic systems that captures electronic correlation effects directly and that improves the nodal structure of quantum wave functions. The RVB is receiving renewed attention in the study of nanoclusters due to the fact that calculations of RVB wave functions have become feasible with recent advances in computer hardware and software.},

	abstract = {Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is an end-to-end learning approach for automated translation, with the potential to overcome many of the weaknesses of conventional phrase-based translation systems. Unfortunately, NMT systems are known to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation inference. Also, most NMT systems have difficulty with rare words. These issues have hindered NMT's use in practical deployments and services, where both accuracy and speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google's Neural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these issues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder layers using attention and residual connections. To improve parallelism and therefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom layer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final translation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference computations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited set of common sub-word units ("wordpieces") for both input and output. This method provides a good balance between the flexibility of "character"-delimited models and the efficiency of "word"-delimited models, naturally handles translation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the system. Our beam search technique employs a length-normalization procedure and uses a coverage penalty, which encourages generation of an output sentence that is most likely to cover all the words in the source sentence. On the WMT'14 English-to-French and English-to-German benchmarks, GNMT achieves competitive results to state-of-the-art. Using a human side-by-side evaluation on a set of isolated simple sentences, it reduces translation errors by an average of 60\% compared to Google's phrase-based production system.},

	abstract = {The general theory of quantum mechanics is now almost complete, the imperfections that still remain being in connection with the exact fitting in of the theory with relativity ideas. These give rise to difficulties only when high-speed particles are involved, and are therefore of no importance in the consideration of atomic and molecular structure and ordinary chemical reactions, in which it is, indeed, usually sufficiently accurate if one neglects relativity variation of mass with velocity and assumes only Coulomb forces between the various electrons and atomic nuclei. The underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty is only that the exact application of these laws leads to equations much too complicated to be soluble. It there fore becomes desirable that approximate practical methods of applying quantum mechanics should be developed, which can lead to an explanation of the main features of complex atomic systems without too much computation. Already before the arrival of quantum mechanics there existed a theory of atomic structure, based on Bohr{\textquoteright}s ideas of quantised orbits, which was fairly successful in a wide field. To get agreement with experiment it was found necessary to introduce the spin of the electron, giving a doubling in the number of orbits of an electron in an atom. With the help of this spin and Pauli{\textquoteright}s exclusion principle, a satisfactory theory of multiplet terms was obtained when one made the additional assumption that the electrons in an atom all set themselves with their spins parallel or antiparallel. If s denoted the magnitude of the resultant spin angular momentum, this s was combined vectorially with the resultant orbital angular momentum l to give a multiplet of multiplicity 2s + 1. The fact that one had to make this additional assumption was, however, a serious disadvantage, as no theoretical reasons to support it could be given. It seemed to show that there were large forces coupling the spin vectors of the electrons in an atom, much larger forces than could be accounted for as due to the interaction of the magnetic moments of the electrons. The position was thus that there was empirical evidence in favour of these large forces, but that their theoretical nature was quite unknown.},

	abstract = {Deep learning has demonstrated tremendous success in variety of application domains in the past few years. This new field of machine learning has been growing rapidly and applied in most of the application domains with some new modalities of applications, which helps to open new opportunity. There are different methods have been proposed on different category of learning approaches, which includes supervised, semi-supervised and un-supervised learning. The experimental results show state-of-the-art performance of deep learning over traditional machine learning approaches in the field of Image Processing, Computer Vision, Speech Recognition, Machine Translation, Art, Medical imaging, Medical information processing, Robotics and control, Bio-informatics, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Cyber security, and many more. This report presents a brief survey on development of DL approaches, including Deep Neural Network (DNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) including Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Auto-Encoder (AE), Deep Belief Network (DBN), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). In addition, we have included recent development of proposed advanced variant DL techniques based on the mentioned DL approaches. Furthermore, DL approaches have explored and evaluated in different application domains are also included in this survey. We have also comprised recently developed frameworks, SDKs, and benchmark datasets that are used for implementing and evaluating deep learning approaches. There are some surveys have published on Deep Learning in Neural Networks [1, 38] and a survey on RL [234]. However, those papers have not discussed the individual advanced techniques for training large scale deep learning models and the recently developed method of generative models [1].},

Here, an alternative approach to estimation of var({\textasciimacron}{\textasciimacron}{\textasciimacron}X) for time series data is presented. The method has an accuracy similar to dependent bootstrapping, but scales in O(n) time, and applies to stationary time series, including stationary Markov chains. The computational complexity is bounded by 12n floating point operations, but this can be reduced to n+O(1) in large computations. Convergence in relative error squared is faster than n-1/2 and the method is insensitive to the probability distribution of the observations. It is proven that a small part of the correlation structure is relevant to the convergence rate of the method. From this, proof of the Blocking method [Flyvbjerg and Petersen, J. Chem. Phys. 91, 461 (1989)] follows as a corollary. The result is also used to propose a hypothesis test surveying the relevant part of the correlation structure.

The method is easily adapted to multithread applications and data larger than computing cluster memory, such as ultralong time series or data streams. This way, the paper provides a stringent and modern treatment of the Blocking method using rigorous linear algebra, multivariate probability theory, real analysis, and Fisherian statistical inference.},

	abstract = {Background: The sample mean \${\textbackslash}overline X = {\textbackslash}sum\_\{i=1\}{\textasciicircum}\{n\}X\_i\$ is probably the most popular estimator of the expected value in all sciences, the standard error is given by the square root of the variance \$V ({\textbackslash}overline\{X\})\$. Purpose: This work aims at providing a stringent and modern treatment of the Blocking method (sensu Flyvbjerg {\textbackslash}\&amp; Petersen 1989), a popular way to compute \$V({\textbackslash}overline\{X\})\$ for correlated data. Methods: Linear algebra, results from multivariate probability theory, real analysis and Fisherian statistical inference were used. The method validation was performed by Metropolis-Hasting-type sampling and autoregressive models. Results: Here a new approach to estimate \$V({\textbackslash}overline\{X\})\$ for time series data is presented. The method applies to stationary data, such as Markov chains and other stationary time series. The complexity of the method is bounded above by \$12n + O({\textbackslash}log\_2 n)\$ floating point operations, but this can be reduced to \$n + O(1)\$ in large computations. The convergence in relative error squared is better than \${\textbackslash}propto n{\textasciicircum}\{-1/2\}\$. The method is insensitive to the probability distribution of the observations. It is proven that only a small part of the correlation structure is relevant to the convergence rate of the method. From this, the 1989 Blocking method follows as a corollary. The result is also used to propose a hypothesis test to survey the relevant part of the correlation structure. The method is sufficiently robust to operate without supervision. An algorithm and sample code showing the implementation is available for Python, C++ and R. This code is available for download at github.com/computative/block. Method validation using autoregressive AR(1)- and AR(2)-processes and physics applications are included. This method has an accuracy similar to dependent bootstrapping, but scales in \$O(n)\$-time. The method is easily adapted to multithread applications and time series larger than computing cluster memory. Conclusions: By applying stringent mathematics, the Blocking method was automated, which will be helpful for all users of this method for computing standard errors of means generated from correlated data series.},

	abstract = {When a large feedforward neural network is trained on a small training set, it typically performs poorly on held-out test data. This "overfitting" is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random "dropout" gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition.},

This tutorial introduces RBMs from the viewpoint of Markov random fields, starting with the required concepts of undirected graphical models. Different learning algorithms for RBMs, including contrastive divergence learning and parallel tempering, are discussed. As sampling from RBMs, and therefore also most of their learning algorithms, are based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, an introduction to Markov chains and MCMC techniques is provided. Experiments demonstrate relevant aspects of RBM training.},

These connections can allow a significant fraction of the knowledge of the system to be applied to an instance of a problem in a very short time. One kind of computation for which massively parallel networks appear to be well suited is large constraint satisfaction searches, but to use the connections efficiently two conditions must be met: First, a search technique that is suitable for parallel networks must be found. Second, there must be some way of choosing internal representations which allow the preexisting hardware connections to be used efficiently for encoding the constraints in the domain being searched. We describe a general parallel search method, based on statistical mechanics, and we show how it leads to a general learning rule for modifying the connection strengths so as to incorporate knowledge about a task domain in an efficient way. We describe some simple examples in which the learning algorithm creates internal representations that are demonstrably the most efficient way of using the preexisting connectivity structure.},

	abstract = {A simple and stable method for computing accurate expectation values of observable with Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) or Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) algorithms is presented. The basic idea consists in replacing the usual ``bare'' estimator associated with the observable by an improved or ``renormalized'' estimator. Using this estimator more accurate averages are obtained: Not only the statistical fluctuations are reduced but also the systematic error (bias) associated with the approximate VMC or (fixed-node) DMC probability densities. It is shown that improved estimators obey a Zero-Variance Zero-Bias (ZVZB) property similar to the usual Zero-Variance Zero-Bias property of the energy with the local energy as improved estimator. Using this property improved estimators can be optimized and the resulting accuracy on expectation values may reach the remarkable accuracy obtained for total energies. As an important example, we present the application of our formalism to the computation of forces in molecular systems. Calculations of the entire force curve of the H\$\_2\$,LiH, and Li\$\_2\$ molecules are presented. Spectroscopic constants \$R\_e\$ (equilibrium distance) and \${\textbackslash}omega\_e\$ (harmonic frequency) are also computed. The equilibrium distances are obtained with a relative error smaller than 1\%, while the harmonic frequencies are computed with an error of about 10\%.},

Monte Carlo simulations can be used to calculate accurately the bulk properties of the light elements hydrogen, helium, and lithium as well as the properties of the isolated atoms and of molecules made up from these elements. It is now possible to make reliable predictions of the behavior of these substances under experimentally difficult conditions, such as high pressure, and of properties that are difficult to measure experimentally, such as the momentum distribution in superfluid helium. For chemical systems, the stochastic method has a number of advantages over the widely used variational approach to determine ground-state properties, namely fast convergence to the exact result within objectively established error bounds.},

	abstract = {At the heart of every good graph drawing algorithm lies an efficient procedure for assigning canvas positions to a graph{\textquoteright}s nodes and the bend points of its edges. However, every real-world implementation of such an algorithm must address numerous problems that have little to do with the actual algorithm, like handling input and output formats, formatting node texts, and styling nodes and edges. We present a new framework, implemented in the Lua programming language and integrated into the TikZ graphics description language, that aims at simplifying the implementation of graph drawing algorithms. Implementers using the framework can focus on the core algorithmic ideas and will automatically profit from the framework{\textquoteright}s pre- and post-processing steps as well as from the extensive capabilities of the TikZ graphics language and the {\textbackslash}TeX{\textbackslash}TeX\{{\textbackslash}hbox\{{\textbackslash}TeX\}\} typesetting engine.

By the simple addition of terms linear in the interelectronic distance, dramatic improvements in the description of the electronic wave function were achieved.

	abstract = {The methods of solution of the wave equation for a central field given in the previous paper are applied to various atoms. For the core electrons, the details of the interaction of the electrons in a single nk group are neglected, but an approximate correction is made for the fact that the distributed charge of an electron does not contribute to the field acting on itself ({\textsection}2).For a given atom the object of the work is to find a field such that the solutions of the wave equation for the core electrons in this field (corrected as just mentioned for each core electron) give a distribution of charge which reproduces the field. This is called the self-consistent field, and the process of finding it is one of successive approximation ({\textsection} 3).Approximations to the self-consistent field have been found for He ({\textsection} 4), Rb+ ({\textsection} 5), Na+, Cl- ({\textsection} 9). For He the energy parameter for the solution of the wave equation for one electron in the self-consistent field of the nucleus and the other corresponds to an ionisation potential of 24{\textperiodcentered}85 volts (observed 24{\textperiodcentered}6 volts); this agreement suggests that for other atoms the values of the energy parameter in the self-consistent field (corrected for each core electron) will probably give good approximations to the X-ray terms ({\textsection}4).The most extensive work has been carried out for Rb+. The distribution of charge given by the wave functions in the self-consistent field is compared with the distribution calculated by other methods ({\textsection} 6). The values of X-ray and optical terms calculated from the self-consistent field show satisfactory agreement with those observed ({\textsection} 7).The wave mechanical analogue of the case in which on the orbital model an internal and an external orbit of the same energy are possible is discussed ({\textsection} 8).},

In turn, at the end of the Second World War scientific computing took a giant step forward with the advent of electronic computers, which greatly accelerated the development of numerical methods. As a result, scientific computing became established as a third scientific method in addition to the two traditional branches: theory and experimentation. The book traces numerical methods{\textquoteright} journey back to their origins and to the people who invented them, while also briefly examining the development of electronic computers over the years.

A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

The amount by which the inequality is violated often provides a good benchmark on how a quantum protocol will perform. Acquiring images of such a fundamental quantum effect is a demonstration that images can capture and exploit the essence of the quantum world. Here, we report an experiment demonstrating the violation of a Bell inequality within observed images. It is based on acquiring full-field coincidence images of a phase object probed by photons from an entangled pair source. The image exhibits a violation of a Bell inequality with S = 2.44 {\textpm} 0.04. This result both opens the way to new quantum imaging schemes based on the violation of a Bell inequality and suggests promise for quantum information schemes based on spatial variables.

Written with exclusive access to Musk, his family and friends, the book traces the entrepreneur's journey from a rough upbringing in South Africa to the pinnacle of the global business world. Vance spent over 40 hours in conversation with Musk and interviewed close to 300 people to tell the tumultuous stories of Musk's world-changing companies: PayPal, Tesla Motors, SpaceX and SolarCity, and to characterize a man who has renewed American industry and sparked new levels of innovation while making plenty of enemies along the way. ~~~~~~~ Vance uses Musk's story to explore one of the pressing questions of our time: can the nation of inventors and creators which led the modern world for a century still compete in an age of fierce global competition? He argues that Musk--one of the most unusual and striking figures in American business history--is a contemporary amalgam of legendary inventors and industrialists like Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs. More than any other entrepreneur today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far-reaching as the visionaries of the golden age of science-fiction fantasy.},

	abstract = {Recently, many applications for Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) have been developed for a large variety of learning problems. However, RBMs are usually used as feature extractors for another learning algorithm or to provide a good initialization for deep feed-forward neural network classifiers, and are not considered as a standalone solution to classification problems. In this paper, we argue that RBMs provide a self-contained framework for deriving competitive non-linear classifiers. We present an evaluation of different learning algorithms for RBMs which aim at introducing a discriminative component to RBM training and improve their performance as classifiers. This approach is simple in that RBMs are used directly to build a classifier, rather than as a stepping stone. Finally, we demonstrate how discriminative RBMs can also be successfully employed in a semi-supervised setting.},

	abstract = {The Faddeev Random Phase Approximation (FRPA) is a Green{\textquoteright}s function method which couples collective degrees of freedom to the single particle motion by resumming an infinite number of Feynman diagrams. The Faddeev technique is applied to describe the two-particle-one-hole (2p1h) and two-hole-one-particle (2h1p) Green{\textquoteright}s function in terms of non-interacting propagators and kernels for the particle-particle (pp) and particle-hole (ph) interactions. This results in an equal treatment of the intermediary pp and ph channels. In FRPA both the pp and ph phonons are calculated on the random phase approximation (RPA) level. In this work the equations that lead to the FRPA eigenvalue problem are derived. The method is then applied to atoms, small molecules and the Hubbard model, for which the ground state energy and the ionization energies are calculated. Special attention is directed to the RPA instability in the dissociation limit of diatomic molecules and in the Hubbard model. Several solutions are proposed to overcome this problem.},
