\titleframe{Software}

\note{We have spent a lot of time developing software, so it deserves to be mentioned. The code is written in object-oriented C++, and was written from scratch since we wanted to test a new path. }

\note{We have developed a software with three aims. Even though our intention is not to compete with existing software, a lots of effort was spent on making the code efficient. This is described in detail in the thesis. Also, the implementation had to be flexible in order to support the restricted Boltzmann ans√§tze. Last, but not least, the developed code should be easy to use.}
