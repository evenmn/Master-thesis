\note{Welcome to my master presentation! It is nice to see that so many of you could be here today! My name is Even, and I will talk about my last years work. It resulted in a master's thesis titled Studies of quantum dots using machine learning. Since I need to compress one years work into 30 minutes, this presentation will not be very technically. For details, I relegate you to this wonderful thesis. }

\note{We will start with some motivation. Thereafter, we present the essential theory, first quantum theory and then machine learning theory. Our primary focus will be on the results, as that's the most interesting outcome of our work. }

\note{Thank you all for listening! Since I have a few more minutes, I will show how the developed software can be used. }
