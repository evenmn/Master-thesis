\chapter{Scientific Programming}
The computer's language itself is binary, and is the lowest level. To translate commands to this language, we need a "translator", which is a language that fills the gap between the binary language and human commands. This language is categorized in levels based on how similar they are to the binary language. Low-level languages are similar to the binary language, which means fast but complicated. High-level languages are easy to work with, but are not as fast as low-level languages. 

\section{Object Orientation}
In C++ one needs to define constructors and destructors. All variables used inside the functions are defines in the constructor, while they are removed in the destructor to free up memory.  In Python, the constructors are called \texttt{\_\_init\_\_} by default, and memory is handled automatically.
\subsection{Inheritance}
Parent and child

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Single inheritance
	\item Multiple inheritances
\end{enumerate}

Python and C++ support multiple inheritances. Multilevel inheritance: Got child and grand child. Hierarchical inheritance: Parent got several children. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inheritance-in-python/
