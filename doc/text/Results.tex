After all, this thesis is about physics and therefore the results and the physical insight should be our focus. Before we move on to the physical results, we will take a quick look at some more technical results, more precisely the computational cost of various wave function structures and the energy convergence using various optimization tools. 

For validation purposes, we will present a few selected results on the case without repulsive interaction and compare to analytical results. Thereafter, we study the case with repulsive interaction in a much larger scale, where we compare various wave function structures for different number of particles and oscillator strengths in two and three dimensions.

\section{Computational cost}
One of the major problems when simulating quantum mechanical systems is the computational cost, which is said to go exponentially as we add more particles. In figure \eqref{fig:cpu_time} the CPU-time is plotted as a function of the number of particles. We observe that RBM, VMC and RBM+SJ,RBM+PJ got pairwise approximately the same cost, where the former are pinched in front. It is not surprise that those are the cheapest, as RBM does have a Jastrow factor and VMC is not dependent on a neural network. RBM appears to be the cheapest method up to $\sim72$ electrons for two dimensional dots, and thereafter VMC takes over the baton. 

The RBM+SJ and RBM+PJ are also quite similar and significantly more expensive than the RBM and VMC. It looks like RBM+PJ is cheaper than RBM+SJ until a certain point, where it suddenly gets more expensive than its counterpart. 

We observe that the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) generally is cheaper to calculate compared to standard variational Monte-Carlo (VMC), which is a bit surprising. In the VMC trial wave function, we have only two variational parameters, while in the RBM we have $N\cdot D\cdot (1+H)+H$ with $N$ as number of particles $D$ as the number of dimensions and $H$ as the number of hidden nodes. Throughout this thesis we always set $H=N$, which was found to give the lowest energies when testing on small systems \cite{nordhagen_computational_2018}. 

With our choice of hidden nodes, we end up with 10,584 parameters for 72 particles in two dimensions and 14,980 parameters for 70 particles in three dimensions. In other words, this evolve to be an optimization problem. The reason why the RBM still appears to have a cheaper cost, is probably that we do not need to calculate the distance matrix over and over again, and the very efficient LAPACK and BLAS packages lie behind the matrix operations. For RBM+SJ and RBM+PJ, the cost is significantly higher because of the update of the distance matrix.

As the applied theory used in quantum many-body simulations agrees perfectly with laboratory experiments, they can be considered as actual experiments. In that manner, one can use computer experiments to verify other experiments and even predict new things. Similarly to experiments in a laboratory, computer experiments are also dependent on external factors, especially when it comes to the CPU-time, and therefore it is important to do such measurements multiple times to find an accurate average time. The CPU-times above are the average from at least four independent runs for each number of particles. All the runs were performed on the Abel computational cluster, which is equipped with Supermicro X9DRT compute nodes with dual Intel E5-2670 CPUs running at 2.6 GHz. Different hardware might provide different CPU-times, but the CPU-time ratios (the exponential factor) should be the same. 

To estimate how fast the cost increases as we add more particles, we do linear regression with a function in form of $f(x)=\alpha x^{\beta}$ where $x$ is the number of particles while $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the unknown parameters to be found. From the limited number of points, we have found the parameters and presented them in table \eqref{tab:cputimefit}. Although the RBM was found to be cheaper than VMC, we can see that the estimated exponential factor $\alpha$ is actually slightly larger. The prefactor $\beta$ is significantly lower though.

\section{Energy convergence}
We want our calculations to converge fast and to be stable, and that is what the optimization tools are responsible for. In figure \eqref{fig:convergenceoptimization}, we compare standard gradient descent to stochastic gradient descent and ADAM for two interacting electrons in a two- and three dimensional well. The frequency $\omega=1.0$ is used for the two-dimensional case since we know that the exact energy is $E=3.0$ for this case \cite{taut_two_1993}. Similarly, we use the frequency $\omega=0.5$ for the three-dimensional case since the exact energy is $E=2.0$ \cite{taut_two_1994}. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering 
	\subfloat[2D, $\omega=1.0$]{{\input{pgf/convergence2D.tex}}}
	\subfloat[3D, $\omega=0.5$]{{\input{pgf/convergence3D.tex}}}
	\caption{Energy convergence for circular quantum dots where we use the optimization tools gradient descent (GD), stochastic gradient descent with 10 batches (SGD) and the ADAM optimizer. The plot in (a) shows a two-dimensional quantum dot of frequency $\omega=1.0$ containing two interacting electrons with exact energy $E=3.0$. The plot in (b) shows a three-dimensional quantum dot of frequency $\omega=0.5$ containing two interacting electrons with exact energy $E=2.0$. We use a standard variational Monte-Carlo wave function, the learning rate was set to $\eta=0.5$ and the number of Metropolis steps used for each iteration was $M=2^{24}=16,777,216$. All energies are given in units of $\hbar$ (Hartree units).}
	\label{fig:convergenceoptimization}
\end{figure} 

The first thing we observe, is that all the three optimization tools manage to converge to the exact energy. The stochastic and non-stochastic gradient descent methods are hard to distinguish, they both converge smoothly. The ADAM optimizer, on the other hand, fluctuates much more. This behavior can be described by the momentum, as discussed in section \ref{sec:momentum}. It is also important to remember that this is the case when we use standard variational Monte-Carlo wave function. The ADAM optimizer is known to be good at machine learning problems, so we will stick to it even though gradient descent seems like a clever choice seen from the figure.

\section{No repulsive interaction} \label{sec:norepulsive}
We start with the non-interacting case in order to validate the implemented code. For this case, we know the exact energy and the exact one-body density for both quantum dots and atoms, which makes it a good test for both systems. The physical significance is though limited, such systems do not appear in the real world. We will first present the quantum dots, before we move on to atoms. 

\subsection{Quantum dots}
Quantum dots will be the system that we will study in highest detail, and therefore most of the validation will be on the quantum dots as well. 

\subsubsection{Ground-state energy}
The single quantum dot has analytical ground-state energies given by equation \eqref{eq:HOenergies} and a number of particles given by the magic numbers in equation \eqref{eq:HOclosedshell}. For some selected number of electrons and for frequencies $\omega=0.5$ and $\omega=1.0$, the obtained energies are presented in table \eqref{tab:quantumdotswointeraction}.

\begin{table} [h]
	\caption{Energy of circular quantum dots of frequency $\omega=0.5$ and $\omega=1.0$ consisting of $N$ non-interacting particles. RBM is a single Slater determinant with a plain Boltzmann machine baked in, while VMC is a standard variational Monte-Carlo Slater determinant. Exact values are obtained by $E=\omega(n+1/2)$, and all values are given in units of $\hbar$.}

		%&6 & 5.0 & 5.0 & 5 & 10.0 & 10.0 & 10 \\
		&12 & 14.0 & 14.0 & 14 & 28.0 & 28.0 & 28\\
		%&20 & 30.0 & 30.0 & 30 & 60.0 & 60.0 & 60\\
		&30 & 55.0 & 55.0 & 55 & 110.0 & 110.0 & 110\\ \hline \\
		
		\parbox[t]{2mm}{\multirow{3}{*}{\rotatebox[origin=c]{90}{3D}}}
		&2 & 1.5 & 1.5 & 1.5 & 3.0 & 3.0 & 3 \\
		%&8 & 9.0 & 9.0 & 9 & 18.0 & 18.0 & 18 \\
		&20 & 30.0 & 30.0 & 30 & 60.0 & 60.0 & 60 \\
		%&40 & 75.0 & 75.0 & 75 & 150.0 & 150.0 & 150 \\
		&70 & 157.5 & 157.5 & 157.5 & 315.0 & 315.0 & 315 \\ \hline\hline
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}
We observe that both the standard VMC, with $\alpha=1$, and standard RBM, with all parameters set to zero, are able to reproduce the analytical expression. This is as expected, since the exact wave functions are found when the parameters have these particular values.

\newpage
\subsubsection{One-body density}
We will also focus on the one-body density throughout this chapter, and comparing the obtained densities to the analytical ones is a good indicator on whether the implementation is correct or not. In figure \eqref{fig:OB_nointeraction} the one-body densities are plotted for quantum dots of two non-interacting electrons in two and three dimensions and frequencies $\omega=0.5$ and $\omega=1.0$. The analytical one-body densities are found from the definition of one-body density in equation \eqref{eq:electron_density}.

We observe that both the standard variational Monte-Carlo wave function and the restricted Boltzmann machine reproduce the analytical one-body density. The distribution gets narrower as the frequency is increased, and we also observe that the distributions are identical for two- and three dimensions with the same frequency.

\subsection{Double quantum dots}
For the double quantum dots, we can also find analytical energies without interaction, as explained in section \ref{sec:doubledots}. We first find the matrix 
\begin{equation*}
\hat{h}_{\nu\lambda}=\mel{\phi_{\nu}^{\text{HO}}(x)}{\hat{\mathcal{H}}_{\text{HO}}}{\phi_{\lambda}^{\text{HO}}(x)}+\mel{\phi_{\nu}^{\text{HO}}(x)}{\hat{\mathcal{H}}_{\text{+}}}{\phi_{\lambda}^{\text{HO}}(x)}
\end{equation*}
for a satisfying number of harmonic oscillator functions. All the symbols are detailed in section \ref{sec:doubledots}. The energies are the eigenvalues of the matrix, which were obtained by the script \texttt{doublewell\_functions.py}. For one particle in one-dimensional potentials, we get the energy $E=0.3095$ for $\omega=1.0$ and $b=2$, and $E=0.1916$ for $\omega=0.5$ and $b=4$. This gives the analytical energies presented in table \eqref{tab:doubledotswointeraction}.

	\caption{Energy of double quantum dots of two non-interacting electrons. RBM is a single Slater determinant with a plain Boltzmann machine baked in, while VMC is a standard variational Monte-Carlo Slater determinant.}

	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\iffalse
\subsection{Atoms}
The second system we will use for validation is atoms. The energy of an atoms containing non-interacting electrons is given by the Bohr formula presented in equation \eqref{eq:bohrformula}. In table \eqref{tab:atomswointeraction}, the lowest closed-shell atoms He, Be and Ne are listed with their exact energy and the obtained energy from the code. In addition, we added calculations of the Hydrogen ground-state energy as another test.

\begin{table} [H]

\section{Quantum dots}
We now move on to the more interesting case with repulsive interaction, where we no longer have analytical results, apart from a few semi-analytical energies and wave functions  for the two- and three-dimensional single quantum dots.

To achieve good results, we apply an adaptive step number, which means that the number of Monte Carlo cycles per iteration is increased for the last iterations. Firstly, this makes the final energy more accurate due to better statistics. Secondly, we get less noisy electron density plots by using this technique. All results below are produced using $2^{20}=1,048,576$ number of steps per iteration for the initial iterations. Then the number of steps is increased to $2^{24}=16,777,216$ when we have 11 iterations left, and for the very last iteration we use $2^{28}=268,435,456$ steps.

Initially we look at standard quantum dots of size up to $N=56$ electrons in 2D and $N=40$ electrons in 3D and frequencies between $\omega=1.0$ and $\omega=0.1$. For those systems, we will compute the ground state energy, the one-body density and the two-body density. 

After that, we move on to some special cases where the dots have low frequency ($\omega=0.01$) and large dots ($N>$56) to test how far we can go. For those systems, we will typically focus on either the ground-state energy or the one-body density dependent on what we want to investigate. For instance, we will focus on the one-body density for low frequency dots because of the search for Wigner crystals. We also have a thorough discussion of how the energy is distributed between kinetic and potential energy, and compare this to the virial theorem. In section \ref{sec:wavefunctions}, we will investigate the various obtained wave function and try to reveal similarities and differences.

\subsection{Ground-state energy} \label{sec:groundstateenergy}
The ground-state energy is a natural start as it is what we try to minimize, and it can easily be compared to benchmarks. By exploiting the symmetry of quantum dots of two electrons, M.Taut was able to obtain semi-analytical energies for some specific frequencies $\omega$. More specifically, he found the energy to be $E=3$ for the frequency $\omega=1$ and $E=2/3$ for the frequency $\omega=1/6$ for the two-dimensional case, and $E=2$ for the frequency $\omega=1/2$ and $E=1/2$ for the frequency $\omega=1/10$ for the three-dimensional case \cite{taut_two_1993,taut_two_1994}.

For other references, we need to rely on what researchers have found before us. Since diffusion Monte-Carlo (DMC) is known to give very accurate results, we will mainly compare our results to J. Høgberget's DMC computations, which exist for quantum dots containing maximum 56 electrons in two dimensions and maximum 20 particles in three dimensions \cite{hogberget_quantum_2013}. Comparing the energy to the Hartree-Fock limit is also interesting, mainly because the Boltzmann machines need to be better to have any significance as Hartree-Fock is much cheaper. We use A.Mariadason's computations for this for quantum dots up to 20 electrons in two dimensions, and up to 8 particles in three dimensions \cite{mariadason_quantum_2018}.

Ground state energy computations of two- and three dimensional quantum dots are found in tables \eqref{tab:quantumdotswinteraction2D1} and \eqref{tab:quantumdotswinteraction3D1} respectively. They are computed by a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), restricted Boltzmann machine with a simple Jastrow factor (RBM+SJ), restricted Boltzmann machine with Padé-Jastrow factor (RBM+PJ) and standard variational Monte-Carlo (VMC). In addition, the Hartree-Fock limit (HF) and diffusion Monte-Carlo (DMC) are present for reference purposes. The exact values are found in the last column with the same name. 

We observe that the method where less physical intuition is used, RBM, is the one that gives the highest energies. This is as expected, but considering that no Jastrow factor is added to account for the correlations, the result is not bad. For small quantum dots (less than 8 particles), the RBM energy is lower than the Hartree-Fock limit, and for low frequencies ($\omega=0.1$ and $0.28$), the RBM energy is also lower. However, for higher frequencies and larger dots, the Hartree-Fock limit is lower than the obtained energy with the RBMs.

When we add more intuition in form of a simple Jastrow factor, the energy drops significantly. The RBM+SJ is not very far from reproducing the reference and provide, without exception, lower energy than the Hartree-Fock limit. This is impressive as it contains among the simplest Jastrow factors we could attain, with absent of the correct cusp condition.

Furthermore, we added a more complex Jastrow factor in the form of a Padé-Jastrow factor, and we observe that the energy drops further. Actually, the RBM+PJ provides energies completely on par with VMC, at least for small quantum dots. It is also the method that provides the lowest standard error, together with VMC.  

We also see that all the methods are able to obtain energies closer to the reference energy in three dimensions compared to two dimensions. This is a well-known concept, and occurs because we have more degrees of freedom. One can imagine that the electrons can move in the space instead of just in the plane, which makes it easier to form a configuration that minimizes the energy. 

Efforts was made to produce results with the partly restricted Boltzmann machine and the deep restricted Boltzmann machine, but they did not behave nicely. 

\subsection{One-body density}
Another quantity of particular interest is the one-body density. For all the systems presented in tables \eqref{tab:quantumdotswinteraction2D1} and \eqref{tab:quantumdotswinteraction3D1} we have also calculated the one-body density. However, since those plots would occupy tens of pages, we will not present all of them here. Instead, we select a few illustrative plots that might me interesting for the reader and give a representative picture of the density. The total collection of one-body density plots can be found in section \ref{sec:onebody} in appendix \ref{chp:totalresults}. 

We have computed the one-body density in two different ways: by dividing the space into annuluses and obtaining the radial density profile, as discussed in section \ref{sec:electrondensityimplementation}, and by dividing the space into a grid of equally sized bins and obtaining the density profile throughout the space. The former is computational beneficial as the density typically is stored in $n$ bins compared to $n^2$ bins for the second method, but the latter is obviously able to store more information. The second method is thereby able to give more informative plots, but when we want to compare the various wave function choices a radial density profile is more convenient. In other words, there are pros and cons associated with both methods, and we will therefore present both to give an as comprehensive description of the results as possible. 

We will start with density profiles of the spaces for two-dimensional quantum dots of frequency $\omega=1.0$. In figure \eqref{fig:OB_interaction_1p0w}, dots of sizes $N=2$, 6, 12, 20, 30 and 40 are presented, produced with a restricted Boltzmann machine. To maximize the amount of information in the plot, we have included a contour plot and a shadow plot in addition to a 3D plot of the density. What we observe is that the density gets a wave form, with more tops as the number of particles increase. Actually, the density plots behave like a water ripple if one sees it from the smallest to the largest dots, as J.Høgberget also points out \cite{hogberget_quantum_2013}. The shapes of the densities are more or less consistent with what he found.

\end{figure}

In figure \eqref{fig:OB_interaction_23D}, we stick to frequency $\omega=1.0$ for small two- and three-dimensional quantum dots and compare the results obtained by VMC, RBM, RBM+SJ and RBM+PJ. We investigate dots of 2, 6 and 12 electrons in two dimensions and 2, 8 and 20 particles in three dimensions, which corresponds to one shell (1S), two shells (2S) and three shells (3S) respectively. For all the cases, we immediately see that the density plots are identical in two and three dimensions for the same closed shell. After all, this is not so surprising considering the fact that particles in a shell of a quantum dot should be at the same distance from the center no matter if we look at the two-, three- or even one-dimensional case. However, what is most interesting for us is to analyze the performance of the Boltzmann machines. We observe that all the methods give quite similar radial density profiles, but RBM is always the guy standing out. Apparently, the RBM tends to over-exaggerate the ripples discussed above and gives an even more wavy density plot, which can be explained by the lack of Jastrow factor to take care of correlations. Further, the RBM+SJ is more similar to the VMC and RBM+PJ, which are almost identical. This is consistent with the energy analysis in section \ref{sec:groundstateenergy}, where we found VMC and RBM+PJ to be most accurate, followed by RBM+SJ and RBM. We also observe an effect where the density plots consequently decrease close to the center, but this is an artifact caused by the fact that the number of Monte Carlo cycles is finite.

In the first column, the density profile for the space are presented for the two-dimensional dots using standard variational Monte Carlo (VMC), and in the second row the corresponding radial density profiles are obtained using VMC, plain restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), restricted Boltzmann machine with simple Jastrow factor (RBM+SJ) and restricted Boltzmann machine with Padé-Jastrow factor.

We now move on to larger dots, containing $N=20$ and $N=42$ electrons with frequencies $\omega=0.1$ and $\omega=0.5$ in addition to the above-studied frequency $\omega=1.0$ to see if we can observe something interesting. In figure \eqref{fig:OB_interaction} we plot the radial density profile to again compare all the methods. What we see, is that the ripples discussed above are conserved for lower frequencies, and they possibly become more significant as the frequency drops. Moreover, both VMC, RBM+PJ and RBM+SJ appear to give quite similar density plots, but for lower frequencies the difference gets more and more visible. Again RBM+SJ also cuts some of the density edges and RBM over-exaggerate the oscillations. Physically, this means that the methods is capable of finding the most likely places to find the electrons, but fails to determine the actual density there. Exactly why the Boltzmann machine gives this result is hard to say, but in section \eqref{sec:wavefunctions} we will try to reveal the secrets behind the Boltzmann wave functions.

\subsection{Two-body density}
We have on multiple occasions discussed the electron density, and we have also mentioned the two-body density. The two-body density is interesting because of the fact that the .. , but for some reason it is hard to find papers that discuss it and thus hard to find benchmarks for the computations. However, someone needs to be the first to present the two-body density plots for quantum dots. Also here we have decided to present the plots for the two-dimensional case only, and picked frequency $\omega=1.0$.  See figure \eqref{fig:TB_interaction_2D}. Emphasize that they are made symmetric. 

We observe that the RBM plots not necessarily are symmetric, while the VMC plots always are symmetric.

\subsection{Energy distribution}
It is also interesting to investigate how the energy is distributed between kinetic energy, external energy and interaction energy for the different methods and various oscillator frequencies. This makes us able to check if the results agree with the virial theorem presented in section \ref{sec:virial}, and it is also interesting to see if the different methods have different energy distribution. In figure \eqref{fig:energysplit2}, the kinetic energy, external potential energy and interaction energy are plotted as a function of oscillator frequency for a two-dimensional quantum dot containing two electrons. The numbers are taken from the tables (\ref{tab:splitfrequencyQDVMC}-\ref{tab:splitfrequencyQDRBMPJ}) in appendix \ref{chp:totalresults}.
\begin{figure}[H]  
	\centering 
	\subfloat[$\langle \hat{T} \rangle$]{{\input{pgf/kinetic.tex}}}
	\subfloat[$\langle \hat{V}_{\text{ext}} \rangle$]{{\input{pgf/external.tex}}}
	\subfloat[$\langle \hat{V}_{\text{int}} \rangle$]{{\input{pgf/interaction.tex}}}
	\caption{In figure (a), the kinetic energy over total energy, $\langle\hat{T}\rangle/\langle\hat{H}\rangle$, of two-dimensional quantum dots containing two electrons are plotted as a function of the oscillator frequency $\omega$. Similar plots for the external potential energy and interaction energy are found in figure (b) and (c) respectively. The methods used are standard variational Monte-Carlo (VMC), plain restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), restricted Boltzmann machine with simple Jastrow factor (RBM+SJ) and restricted Boltzmann machine with Padé-Jastrow factor.}
	\label{fig:energysplit2}
\end{figure} 

One can observe that the kinetic energy and potential energy are dominant for high frequencies, but as the frequency is decreased the interaction energy gets ever more important. At frequency $\omega=0.01$, the interaction energy actually accounts for 50\% of the energy, while the kinetic energy accounts for about 10\% of the energy. We predicted this already in section \ref{sec:wigner}.

We also see a significant difference between the methods, where the plain restricted Boltzmann machine is the one that really stands out as the interaction energy is higher and the kinetic energy amount is lower. This is not very surprising, considering that it does not have any Jastrow factor to take care of the interactions. This apparently gives a higher interaction energy and a lower kinetic energy.

We do the same exercise for quantum dots of 20 electrons in two dimensions, and get the plots presented in figure \eqref{fig:energysplit20}. What we observe is that the shapes of the graphs are quite similar to the graphs for two particles, but the values are completely different. However, the potential energy dominates the kinetic energy in a, if possible, even more markedly way than for the smaller dot with two electrons. Most notably is the kinetic energy, which account for a much lower amount of the total energy for 20 particles than for two particles. This is naturally related to the increase in the interaction energy, which is naturally as we increase the number of energies. Also the numbers which the plots are based on were taken from appendix \ref{chp:totalresults}.

\newpage
If we now recall the virial theorem in section \ref{sec:virial}, it states that the kinetic energy is related to the potential energies in a certain way. For the interaction quantum dot system, the virial theorem reads
\begin{equation}
2\langle \hat{T} \rangle=2\langle \hat{V}_{\text{ext}} \rangle-\langle \hat{V}_{\text{int}} \rangle
\end{equation}
which can be verified from the energy splitting. To do this accurately, we better list up the exact energies, which for a two-dimensional quantum dot is given in table \eqref{tab:splitfrequencyQD2D} for some selected frequencies. For more frequencies and system sizes, please look at appendix \ref{chp:totalresults}. By doing the math, we see that the virial theorem is satisfied for low frequencies, but as the frequency increases the theorem gets more and more off. This is the case for all the methods.

\subsection{Low frequency dots} \label{sec:lowfrequencies}
As we pointed out in section \ref{sec:wigner}, and as shown in the previous section, the potential energy dominates the kinetic energy as low frequencies. This means that the electrons have a lower average momentum, which makes Wigner crystallization possible. As already discussed in the theory part, this phenomenon can be observed by some distinct peaks in the one-body density plots. In figure \eqref{fig:lowfreqOB}, the one-body density is plotted for low frequency dots containing 2, 6, 12 and 20 particles. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\subfloat[2P]{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{/home/evenmn/VMC/plots/int1/onebody/2D/2P/0.010000w/ADAM_MC2pow28.png}}
	\subfloat[6P]{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{/home/evenmn/VMC/plots/int1/onebody/2D/2P/0.010000w/ADAM_MC2pow28.png}}\\

	\caption{One-body density of two-dimensional circular quantum dots. $\omega=0.01$.}
	\label{fig:lowfreqOB}
\end{figure}

For two particles, we can see that the one-body density has a peak at a distance from origin, and a local minimum in origin. This means that the probability of finding the two electrons close to each other is low, which is as expected due to the low momentum. 

\iffalse
\subsection{$S\neq0$}
When the number of particles in the quantum dot is among the magic numbers presented in equation \eqref{eq:HOclosedshell}, the ground state is guaranteed to be found at $L=S=0$. However, if we want to look at dots of other sizes, this is often not true, and we will therefore look at some cases with $S\neq 0$. We will still stick to $L=0$ and closed shell systems.

Imagine a dot of four particles with $S=1$ (three have spin up and the last has spin down). The ground state is obviously found when a spin up and a spin down particle is in the lowest energy state, and the remaining particles are in the first excited energy state. Since the lowest states and the first excited states with spin up are filled up, this is a closed shell system.

Again, our results will be benchmarked to DMC, with references Ref.\cite{pederiva_diffusion_2000} and Ref.\cite{ghosal_incipient_2007}. The former reference also presents Hartree-Fock results which we also will use. 

The results are listed in table \eqref{tab:sneq0}, where we use a restricted Boltzmann machine with Padé-Jastrow factor (RBM+PJ) and standard variational Monte-Carlo (VMC). 

We find both the RBM+PJ and VMC to reproduce the reference energy in all the cases.

\subsection{Large dots}
In order to test the code, we also decided to run for systems with $N>56$. This has no scientific significance, other than testing how far a VMC code can go. One thing is that the computations get extremely expensive as the number of particle increases, but also the standard error is assumed to increase due to.. This means that we cannot just crack up the wall clock time and wait when studying large systems, at some point the standard error gets insufficiently large and we need to further increase the number of Monte Carlo cycles. The learning rate also needs to be decreased as the system sizes increase, which requires more iterations.  We look at weakly interacting particles, so we will not get any relativistic effects even when adding many particles.

\subsection{Wave functions} \label{sec:wavefunctions}

\section{Double quantum dots}
Double quantum dots are systems that are very interesting when it comes to testing the Boltzmann machines. Even though we know the wave functions for the non-interacting case, they are expansions that are computational expensive to work with.

\subsection{Ground state energy}
For the interacting case, we will use Alocias Mariadason's VMC calculations with and without a Hartree-Fock basis as a reference. In addition, Jørgen Høgberget provides a DMC energy for the case with two particles and $\omega=1.0$. All the results are given in table \eqref{tab:doubleQD}.

What we observe, is that the Boltzmann machine with a Padé-Jastrow factor outperforms a Hermite expansion of 10 functions, which is surprising. The reason might be that the Boltzmann machine consists of a sum over all hidden nodes, which makes it behave similar to an expansion. However, the Boltzmann machine was then again beat by the Hermite expansion with a Hartree-Fock basis.

The next set of systems we will address are the real Atoms, which have been investigated by physicists since the childhood of quantum mechanics, and for that reason we have an array of computational and experimental references to use.
