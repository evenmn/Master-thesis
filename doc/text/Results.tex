We are finally ready to discuss the most interesting part of this thesis, namely the results. Since this work, after all, is about physics the physical insight should be our focus, and in this chapter we finally get the opportunity to discuss pure physics. However, we will also use this section for the comparison of restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and the standard variational Monte Carlo method (VMC) to see which one that works best and in which situations they differ. Actually, we will look at three versions of the RBM; a Slater determinant consisting of Boltzmann machines only (RBM), a RBM with the simple Jastrow factor described in section \ref{sec:simplejastrow} (RBM+SJ) and a RBM with the Padé-Jastrow factor described in section \ref{sec:padejastrow} (RBM+PJ). The VMC consists of a Slater determinant containing standard single-particle functions and the Padé-Jastrow factor. 

As we can look at various systems, system sizes, system strengths and innumerous hyper-parameter settings by different methods, the number of results we possibly can obtain is uncountable. In total, we have looked at more than 150 different quantum dot systems using four methods, which means that we have generated a large set of results. Just a small subset of those results will be presented and discussed in this chapter, while a larger collection of results is presented in appendix \ref{chp:totalresults}. The results presented above were selected since they describe physical properties and compare the various methods in a good way. Typically, we will choose settings that are comparable to what others have obtained, such that we can benchmark the calculations. Our main focus will be on ground-state energy and electron density calculations. 

Before we move on to the physical results, we will take a quick look at some more technical results, more precisely the computational cost of various wave function structures and the energy convergence using various optimization tools. For validation purposes, we will present a few selected results on the case without repulsive interaction and compare to analytical results. Thereafter, we study the case with repulsive interaction in a much larger scale, where we first look at single quantum dots and then on double quantum dots. In the end we present some very limited results on simple atoms to show the flexibility of the code. 

\section{Computational cost}
One of the major problems when simulating quantum mechanical systems is the computational cost, which is due to the large amount of information that needs to be stored in a wave function. Albeit the standard variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method is known to have a high performance-cost ratio, the it is still not cheap. In this section we will find the average cost of VMC and compare the cost to a plain restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), restricted Boltzmann machine with a simple Jastrow factor (RBM+SJ) and a restricted Boltzmann machine with a Padé-Jastrow factor (RBM+PJ). In figure \eqref{fig:cpu_time} the CPU-time is plotted as a function of the number of particles for two-dimensional (a) and three-dimensional (b) quantum dots. To obtain accurate times, all the simulations were run on the Abel computer cluster with $M=2^{20}=1,048,576$ Monte Carlo cycles per iteration. The time presented is the average time over at least four independent runs with thousands of iterations each. To see the actual numbers, go to appendix \ref{chp:totalresults}, section \ref{sec:cputime}.

\end{figure} 

Our immediate observation is that the methods are pairwise quite similar, with RBM and VMC as the cheapest methods and RBM+SJ and RBM+PJ are the most expensive ones. This is not surprising, as the RBM requires a neural network, VMC requires a Jastrow factor while RBM+SJ and RBM+SJ requires both a neural network and a Jastrow factor. 

For two-dimensional dots, the RBM is the cheapest among all the methods, but for larger systems ($N=42,56$ with $N$ as number of electrons), VMC get cheaper due to an explosion in CPU-time for the RBM. This explosion can be described by our choice of number of hidden nodes, $H$, which consequently is set to the number of electrons, i.e., $H=N$ , which was found to give the lowest energies when testing on small quantum dots \cite{nordhagen_computational_2018}. Since the RBM has $N\cdot D\cdot (1+H)+H$ variational parameters with $D$ as the number of dimensions, the number of variational parameters for a dot containing 90 particles in two dimensions in 16,470! On the other hand, VMC has two variational parameters which obviously makes a difference. 

We also see that RBM+PJ is cheaper than RBM+SJ for systems up to $N=42$, but after that the RBM+SJ gets slightly cheaper. This might be surprising, as the simple Jastrow contains $N^2$ variational parameters, but a possibility is that BLAS is optimized for large matrix-vector operations and is thus fully utilized first when the matrices get large. The exact same behavior is observed for three-dimensional quantum dots, and the discussion above is describing for them as well.

To estimate how fast the cost increases as we add more particles, we do linear regression with a function in form of $f(x)= ax^b$ where $x$ is the number of particles while $a$ and $b$ are the unknown parameters to be found. From the limited number of points, we have found the parameters and presented them in table \eqref{tab:cputimefit}. Although the RBM was found to be cheaper than VMC, we can see that the estimated exponential factor $a$ is actually slightly larger. The prefactor $b$ is significantly lower though.

\section{Energy convergence}
We want our calculations to converge fast and to be stable, and that is what the optimization tools are responsible for. In figure \eqref{fig:convergenceoptimization}, we compare standard gradient descent to stochastic gradient descent and ADAM for quantum dots containing two interacting electrons in a two- and three dimensions. The frequency $\omega=1.0$ is used for the two-dimensional case since we know that the exact energy is $E=3.0$ for this case \cite{taut_two_1993}. Similarly, we use the frequency $\omega=0.5$ for the three-dimensional case since the exact energy is $E=2.0$ \cite{taut_two_1994}. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering 
	\subfloat{{\input{pgf/convergence2D.tex}}}
	\caption{Energy convergence for circular quantum dots where we use the optimization tools gradient descent (GD), stochastic gradient descent with 10 batches (SGD) and the ADAM optimizer. The plot in (a) shows a two-dimensional quantum dot of frequency $\omega=1.0$ containing two interacting electrons with exact energy $E=3.0$. The plot in (b) shows a three-dimensional quantum dot of frequency $\omega=0.5$ containing two interacting electrons with exact energy $E=2.0$. To obtain the graphs, we use VMC detailed in the introductory words of this chapter, the learning rate was set to $\eta=0.5$ and the number of Metropolis steps used for each iteration was $M=2^{24}=16,777,216$. All energies are given in units of $\hbar$ (Hartree units).}
	\label{fig:convergenceoptimization}
\end{figure} 

The first thing we observe, is that all the three optimization tools manage to converge to the exact energy. The stochastic and non-stochastic gradient descent methods are hard to distinguish, they both converge smoothly. The ADAM optimizer, on the other hand, fluctuates much more. This behavior can be described by the momentum, as discussed in section \ref{sec:momentum}. It is also important to remember that this is the case when we use standard variational Monte-Carlo wave function. The ADAM optimizer is known to be good at machine learning problems, so we will stick to it even though gradient descent seems like a clever choice seen from the figure.

\section{No repulsive interaction} \label{sec:norepulsive}
We start with the non-interacting case in order to validate the implemented code. For this case, we know the exact energy and the exact one-body density for both single and double quantum dots, which makes it a good test for both systems. The physical significance is though limited, such systems do not appear in the real world. We will first present the quantum dots, before we move on to double quantum dots. 

\subsection{Quantum dots}
Quantum dots will be the system that we will study in highest detail, and therefore most of the validation will be on the quantum dots as well. 

\subsubsection{Ground-state energy}
The single quantum dot has analytical ground-state energies given by equation \eqref{eq:HOenergies} and a number of particles given by the magic numbers in equation \eqref{eq:HOclosedshell}. For some selected number of electrons and for frequencies $\omega=0.5$ and $\omega=1.0$, the obtained energies are presented in table \eqref{tab:quantumdotswointeraction}.

\begin{table}
	\caption{Energy of circular quantum dots of frequency $\omega=0.5$ and $\omega=1.0$ containing $N$ non-interacting particles. All the methods used were detailed in the introductory words of this chapter. Exact values are obtained by $E=\omega(n+1/2)$, and all values are given in units of $\hbar$. The standard error is zero down to machine precision.}

		\parbox[t]{2mm}{\multirow{3}{*}{\rotatebox[origin=c]{90}{3D}}}
		&2 & 1.5 & 1.5 & 1.5 & 3.0 & 3.0 & 3 \\

		&70 & 157.5 & 157.5 & 157.5 & 315.0 & 315.0 & 315 \\ \hline\hline
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}
We observe that both the standard VMC, with $\alpha=1$, and standard RBM, with all parameters set to zero, are able to reproduce the analytical expression. This is as expected, since the exact wave functions are found when the parameters have these particular values.

\subsubsection{Electron density}
We will also focus on the electron density throughout this chapter, and comparing the obtained densities to the analytical ones is a good indicator on whether the implementation is correct or not. In figure \eqref{fig:OB_nointeraction} the one-body densities are plotted for quantum dots of two non-interacting electrons in two and three dimensions with frequency $\omega=1.0$. In part (a) the simulated distribution using VMC throughout the space is given, while in (b) and (c) the radial density profile for VMC, RBM and the exact profile is given in two and three dimensions respectively. We observe that both VMC and RBM are more or less able to reproduce the exact distribution, which indicated that we have done the implementation correctly. However, the densities get noisy when they approach $r=0$, most notably in three dimensions, which is caused by the way we calculate the one-body densities. In section \ref{sec:electrondensityimplementation}, we saw that the innermost bins are also the smallest, which means that particles are less likely to be observed there when the number of Monte Carlo cycles is finite. This artifact is not found in part (a), because that one-body density was computed by dividing the space into equally sized squares. Apart from this noise, the density plot in two and three dimensions are identical, which can be explained mathematically by the fact that the non-interacting electron densities are separable. The analytical one-body densities are found from the definition of one-body density in equation \eqref{eq:electron_density}.

\begin{figure}[h]

	\subfloat[VMC]{{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth/3]{/home/evenmn/VMC/plots/int0/onebody2/2D/2P/1.000000w/VMC_GD_MC2pow30_blue_small.png} }}

Both the methods used were detailed in the introductory words of this chapter and the exact solution was found from the definition of one-body density found in equation \eqref{eq:electron_density}.}
	\label{fig:OB_nointeraction}
\end{figure}

Also the two-body density is interesting to investigate as it might provides information about the interactions that the one-body density cannot give us. The radial two-body density profile is computed in the same way as the radial one-body density profile, and we expect therefore to observe the same artifact where the density drops in the center. In figure \eqref{fig:TB_nointeraction}, we plot the obtained two-body density using VMC (a) and the exact density found from equation \eqref{eq:electron_density} (b). We observe that the simulated two-body density is similar to the exact one, but apparently not as smooth. We also get a cross on the simulated density profile, which occurs since we in practice only simulate one quadrant and add the three other quadrants to make the plot more intuitive. As we have seen before, the electron densities are separable without interaction, which means that the radial two-body density presented here simply is the radial one-body density rotated in space.

VMC was detailed in the introductory words of this chapter.}%
	\label{fig:TB_nointeraction}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Double quantum dots}
For the double quantum dots, we can also find analytical energies without interaction, as explained in section \ref{sec:doubledots}. We first find the matrix 
\begin{equation*}
\hat{h}_{\nu\lambda}=\mel{\phi_{\nu}^{\text{HO}}(x)}{\hat{\mathcal{H}}_{\text{HO}}}{\phi_{\lambda}^{\text{HO}}(x)}+\mel{\phi_{\nu}^{\text{HO}}(x)}{\hat{\mathcal{H}}_{\text{+}}}{\phi_{\lambda}^{\text{HO}}(x)}
\end{equation*}
for a satisfying number of harmonic oscillator functions. All the symbols are detailed in section \ref{sec:doubledots}. The energies are the eigenvalues of the matrix, which were obtained by the script \texttt{doublewell\_functions.py}. For one particle in one-dimensional potentials, we get the energy $E=0.3095$ for $\omega=1.0$ and $b=2$, and $E=0.1916$ for $\omega=0.5$ and $b=4$. This gives the analytical energies presented in table \eqref{tab:doubledotswointeraction}.

	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\subsection{Atoms}
The second system we will use for validation is atoms. The energy of an atoms containing non-interacting electrons is given by the Bohr formula presented in equation \eqref{eq:bohrformula}. In table \eqref{tab:atomswointeraction}, the lowest closed-shell atoms He, Be and Ne are listed with their exact energy and the obtained energy from the code. In addition, we added calculations of the Hydrogen ground-state energy as another test.

\end{table}

\newpage
\section{Quantum dots}
We now move on to the more interesting case with repulsive interaction, where we no longer have analytical results, apart from a few semi-analytical energies and wave functions  for the two- and three-dimensional single quantum dots.

To achieve good results, we apply an adaptive step number, which means that the number of Monte Carlo cycles per iteration is increased for the last iterations. Firstly, this makes the final energy more accurate due to better statistics. Secondly, we get less noisy electron density plots by using this technique. All results below are produced using $2^{20}=1,048,576$ number of steps per iteration for the initial iterations. Then the number of steps is increased to $2^{24}=16,777,216$ when we have 11 iterations left, and for the very last iteration we use $2^{28}=268,435,456$ steps.

Initially we look at standard quantum dots of size up to $N=56$ electrons in 2D and $N=40$ electrons in 3D and frequencies between $\omega=1.0$ and $\omega=0.1$. For those systems, we will compute the ground state energy, the one-body density and the two-body density. 

After that, we move on to some special cases where the dots have low frequency ($\omega=0.01$) and large dots ($N>$56) to test how far we can go. For those systems, we will typically focus on either the ground-state energy or the one-body density dependent on what we want to investigate. For instance, we will focus on the one-body density for low frequency dots because of the search for Wigner crystals. We also have a thorough discussion of how the energy is distributed between kinetic and potential energy, and compare this to the virial theorem. In section \ref{sec:wavefunctions}, we will investigate the various obtained wave function and try to reveal similarities and differences.

\subsection{Ground-state energy} \label{sec:groundstateenergy}
The ground-state energy is a natural start as it is what we try to minimize, and it can easily be compared to benchmarks. By exploiting the symmetry of quantum dots of two electrons, M.Taut was able to obtain semi-analytical energies for some specific frequencies $\omega$. More specifically, he found the energy to be $E=3$ for the frequency $\omega=1$ and $E=2/3$ for the frequency $\omega=1/6$ for the two-dimensional case, and $E=2$ for the frequency $\omega=1/2$ and $E=1/2$ for the frequency $\omega=1/10$ for the three-dimensional case \cite{taut_two_1993,taut_two_1994}.

For other references, we need to rely on what researchers have found before us. Since diffusion Monte-Carlo (DMC) is known to give very accurate results, we will mainly compare our results to J. Høgberget's DMC computations, which exist for quantum dots containing maximum 56 electrons in two dimensions and maximum 20 particles in three dimensions \cite{hogberget_quantum_2013}. Comparing the energy to the Hartree-Fock limit is also interesting, mainly because the Boltzmann machines need to be better to have any significance as Hartree-Fock is much cheaper. We use A.Mariadason's computations for this for quantum dots up to 20 electrons in two dimensions, and up to 8 particles in three dimensions \cite{mariadason_quantum_2018}.

Ground state energy computations of two- and three dimensional quantum dots are found in tables \eqref{tab:quantumdotswinteraction2D1} and \eqref{tab:quantumdotswinteraction3D1} respectively. They are computed by a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), restricted Boltzmann machine with a simple Jastrow factor (RBM+SJ), restricted Boltzmann machine with Padé-Jastrow factor (RBM+PJ) and standard variational Monte-Carlo (VMC). In addition, the Hartree-Fock limit (HF) and diffusion Monte-Carlo (DMC) are present for reference purposes. The exact values are found in the last column with the same name. 

We observe that the method where less physical intuition is used, RBM, is the one that gives the highest energies. This is as expected, but considering that no Jastrow factor is added to account for the correlations, the result is not bad. For small quantum dots (less than 8 particles), the RBM energy is lower than the Hartree-Fock limit, and for low frequencies ($\omega=0.1$ and $0.28$), the RBM energy is also lower. However, for higher frequencies and larger dots, the Hartree-Fock limit is lower than the obtained energy with the RBMs.

When we add more intuition in form of a simple Jastrow factor, the energy drops significantly. The RBM+SJ is not very far from reproducing the reference and provide, without exception, lower energy than the Hartree-Fock limit. This is impressive as it contains among the simplest Jastrow factors we could attain, with absent of the correct cusp condition.

Furthermore, we added a more complex Jastrow factor in the form of a Padé-Jastrow factor, and we observe that the energy drops further. Actually, the RBM+PJ provides energies completely on par with VMC, at least for small quantum dots. It is also the method that provides the lowest standard error, together with VMC.  

We also see that all the methods are able to obtain energies closer to the reference energy in three dimensions compared to two dimensions. This is a well-known concept, and occurs because we have more degrees of freedom. One can imagine that the electrons can move in the space instead of just in the plane, which makes it easier to form a configuration that minimizes the energy. 

Efforts was made to produce results with the partly restricted Boltzmann machine and the deep restricted Boltzmann machine, but they did not behave nicely. 

\subsection{One-body density}
Another quantity of particular interest is the one-body density. For all the systems presented in tables \eqref{tab:quantumdotswinteraction2D1} and \eqref{tab:quantumdotswinteraction3D1} we have also calculated the one-body density. However, since those plots would occupy tens of pages, we will not present all of them here. Instead, we select a few illustrative plots that might me interesting for the reader and give a representative picture of the density. The total collection of one-body density plots can be found in section \ref{sec:onebody} in appendix \ref{chp:totalresults}. 

We have computed the one-body density in two different ways: by dividing the space into annuluses and obtaining the radial density profile, as discussed in section \ref{sec:electrondensityimplementation}, and by dividing the space into a grid of equally sized bins and obtaining the density profile throughout the space. The former is computational beneficial as the density typically is stored in $n$ bins compared to $n^2$ bins for the second method, but the latter is obviously able to store more information. The second method is thereby able to give more informative plots, but when we want to compare the various wave function choices a radial density profile is more convenient. In other words, there are pros and cons associated with both methods, and we will therefore present both to give an as comprehensive description of the results as possible. 

We will start with density profiles of the spaces for two-dimensional quantum dots of frequency $\omega=1.0$. In figure \eqref{fig:OB_interaction_1p0w1} and \eqref{fig:OB_interaction_1p0w2}, dots of sizes $N=2$, 6, 12, 20, 30 and 40 are presented, produced with RBM and VMC. To maximize the amount of information in the plot, we have included a contour plot and a shadow plot in addition to a 3D plot of the density. What we observe is that the density gets a wave shape, with more peaks as the number of particles increases. The RBM provides sharper and more distinct peaks than the VMC, but at least the extrema seems to be located at the same radii.  Actually, the density plots behave like a water ripple if one sees it from the smallest to the largest dots, as J.Høgberget also points out \cite{hogberget_quantum_2013}. The shapes of the densities are more or less consistent with what he found.

In figure \eqref{fig:OB_interaction_23D}, we stick to frequency $\omega=1.0$ for small two- and three-dimensional quantum dots and compare the results obtained by VMC, RBM, RBM+SJ and RBM+PJ. We investigate dots of 2, 6 and 12 electrons in two dimensions and 2, 8 and 20 particles in three dimensions, which corresponds to one shell (1S), two shells (2S) and three shells (3S) respectively. For all the cases, we immediately see that the density plots are identical in two and three dimensions for the same closed shell. After all, this is not so surprising considering the fact that particles in a shell of a quantum dot should be at the same distance from the center no matter if we look at the two-, three- or even one-dimensional case. However, what is most interesting for us is to analyze the performance of the Boltzmann machines. We observe that all the methods give quite similar radial density profiles, but RBM is always the guy standing out. Apparently, the RBM tends to over-exaggerate the ripples discussed above and gives an even more wavy density plot, which can be explained by the lack of Jastrow factor to take care of correlations. Further, the RBM+SJ is more similar to the VMC and RBM+PJ, which are almost identical. This is consistent with the energy analysis in section \ref{sec:groundstateenergy}, where we found VMC and RBM+PJ to be most accurate, followed by RBM+SJ and RBM. We also observe an effect where the density plots consequently decrease close to the center, but this is an artifact caused by the fact that the number of Monte Carlo cycles is finite.

We now move on to larger dots, containing $N=20$ and $N=42$ electrons with frequencies $\omega=0.1$ and $\omega=0.5$ in addition to the above-studied frequency $\omega=1.0$ to see if we can observe something interesting. In figure \eqref{fig:OB_interaction} we plot the radial density profile to again compare all the methods. What we see, is that the ripples discussed above are conserved for lower frequencies, and they possibly become more significant as the frequency drops. Moreover, both VMC, RBM+PJ and RBM+SJ appear to give quite similar density plots, but for lower frequencies the difference gets more and more visible. Again RBM+SJ also cuts some of the density edges and RBM over-exaggerate the oscillations. Physically, this means that the methods is capable of finding the most likely places to find the electrons, but fails to determine the actual density there. Exactly why the Boltzmann machine gives this result is hard to say, but in section \eqref{sec:wavefunctions} we will try to reveal the secrets behind the Boltzmann wave functions.

\subsection{Two-body density}
We have on multiple occasions discussed the electron density, and we have also mentioned the two-body density. The two-body density is interesting because it gives the probability of finding two particles at certain relative distances from the center of the dot. Similarly to the one-body density, we can both plot the radial two-body density profile and the actual two-body density distribution throughout the space. However, since the latter results in a higher-dimensional plot, we stick to the radial density profile. Also for this quantity it would be convenient to have references to benchmark our results to, but for some reason it is hard to find papers that discuss the two-body density for quantum dots. Nevertheless, someone needs to be the first and we will use the plots to discuss the physics and compare the various methods in the best possible way. Again we will emphasize that a negative radial distance does not make sense, so all the quadrants are the same and presented in this way to make it more illustrative and intuitive.

Again, we will focus on the two-dimensional case, as the three-dimensional case becomes similar as for the one-body density. In figure \eqref{fig:TB_interaction_2P} we plot the two-body densities for a two-dimensional quantum dot at various frequencies containing two electrons. For frequency $\omega=1.0$, the density plots for all the methods give quite similar results, but it seems like the RBM find the electrons closer to the center than the other methods. This can be explained by the absent of a Jastrow factor. Also the RBM+SJ gives a slightly more narrow distribution than the RBM+PJ and VMC, so it is apparent that the Padé-Jastrow factor results in a more repulsive factor than the simple Jastrow factor. We known that the potential, and thus the interactions get more dominating as the frequency is decreased. For VMC and RBM+PJ we can observe this by a circle of higher density at a certain distance from the origin both for $\omega=0.5$ and $\omega=0.1$, which means that both particles are less likely to be found in the center of the dot at the same time. If one particle is close to the center, the other particle is probably far from the center. For the RBM+SJ, this behavior can only be observed for $\omega=0.1$, while the RBM is not able to reproduce this phenomenon at all. This shows that the Padé-Jastrow factor is more correct than the simple Jastrow factor, as expected. 

The calculations are repeated for two-dimensional quantum dots of 20 electrons, which are presented in figure \eqref{fig:TB_interaction_20P}. For $\omega=1.0$, all the methods give approximately the same density distribution where the most likely area is located where an electron is far from the center and the other is close to the center and vice versa. However, the RBM finds the most likely configurations to be more discrete distributed than the other methods, which is even more significant for the frequency $\omega=0.5$. This is the same behavior as we saw for the two-body density, where we argued that it can be explained by the absent of a Jastrow factor. For frequency $\omega=0.1$, the same circle around the origin as we saw for the two-particle case can be observed, but it is not as notable since the scales along the axis are totally different. We also see that the RBM+PJ and VMC give a low probability of finding an electron pair at the same distance from the center at the same time. This can also be recognized from the one-body density plot in \eqref{fig:OB_interaction}, where we see that the radial density profile is quite flat. We also see that the VMC always gives symmetric two-body density plots around $r_i=r_j$, which means that the wave function is symmetric with respect to the radial distance of two particles. On the other hand, the RBM wave function is not necessary symmetric, which results in non-symmetric plots for RBM, RBM+SJ and RBM+PJ.

\subsection{Energy distribution}
It is also interesting to investigate how the energy is distributed between kinetic energy, external energy and interaction energy for the different methods and various oscillator frequencies. This makes us able to check if the results agree with the virial theorem presented in section \ref{sec:virial}, and it is also interesting to see if the different methods give different energy distribution. In figure \eqref{fig:energysplitVMC2D}, the ratio between the kinetic and potential energy as a function of oscillator frequency for two-dimensional quantum dots of various sizes is plotted. The numbers are taken from the tables (\ref{tab:splitfrequencyQDVMC}-\ref{tab:splitfrequencyQDRBMPJ}) in appendix \ref{chp:totalresults}. 

We see a significant trend where the ratio drops as the frequency decreases. This means that the potential energy dominates the kinetic energy at low frequencies, which is a known phenomenon already mentioned several times throughout this thesis. For all the methods, the ratio is also lower for larger dots, which is because we have more particles and thereby gradually more interaction energy. The various methods also give more or less the same ratios spanning from around 0.65 to 0.01, but some of the plots are more noisy than the others. Most notably, the RBM+SJ provides smooth curves, but this is probably just a coincidence, there is not reason why this method should behave more nicely than the others. 

It also looks like the ratio approaches a linear slope for higher frequencies, even though we have too few points to say anything with certainty. If we now recall the virial theorem in section \ref{sec:virial}, it states that the kinetic energy is related to the potential energies in a certain way. For the interaction quantum dot system, the virial theorem reads
\begin{equation}
2\langle \hat{T} \rangle=2\langle \hat{V}_{\text{ext}} \rangle-\langle \hat{V}_{\text{int}} \rangle
\end{equation}
which can be verified from the energy splitting. To do this accurately, we better list up the exact energies, which for a two-dimensional quantum dot with 20 electrons is given in table \eqref{tab:splitfrequencyQD20P} for some selected frequencies. For more frequencies and system sizes, please look at appendix \ref{chp:totalresults}. By doing the math, we see that the virial theorem is satisfied for high frequencies, but as the frequency decreases the theorem gets more and more off. This is the case for all the methods, and is also observed for other system sizes.

\subsection{Low frequency dots} \label{sec:lowfrequencies}
As we pointed out in section \ref{sec:wigner}, and as shown in the previous section, the potential energy dominates the kinetic energy as low frequencies. This means that the electrons have a lower average momentum, which makes Wigner crystallization possible. As already discussed in the theory part, this phenomenon can be observed by some distinct peaks in the one-body density plots. In figure \eqref{fig:lowfreqOB}, the one-body density is plotted for low frequency dots containing 2, 6, 12 and 20 particles.

For two particles, we can see that the one-body density has a peak at a distance from origin, and a local minimum in origin. This means that the probability of finding the two electrons close to each other is low, which is as expected due to the low momentum.

\subsection{$S\neq0$}
When the number of particles in the quantum dot is among the magic numbers presented in equation \eqref{eq:HOclosedshell}, the ground state is guaranteed to be found at $L=S=0$. However, if we want to look at dots of other sizes, this is often not true, and we will therefore look at some cases with $S\neq 0$. We will still stick to $L=0$ and closed shell systems.

Imagine a dot of four particles with $S=1$ (three have spin up and the last has spin down). The ground state is obviously found when a spin up and a spin down particle is in the lowest energy state, and the remaining particles are in the first excited energy state. Since the lowest states and the first excited states with spin up are filled up, this is a closed shell system.

Again, our results will be benchmarked to DMC, with references Ref.\cite{pederiva_diffusion_2000} and Ref.\cite{ghosal_incipient_2007}. The former reference also presents Hartree-Fock results which we also will use. 

The results are listed in table \eqref{tab:sneq0}, where we use a restricted Boltzmann machine with Padé-Jastrow factor (RBM+PJ) and standard variational Monte-Carlo (VMC). 

We find both the RBM+PJ and VMC to reproduce the reference energy in all the cases.

\subsection{Large dots}
In order to test the code, we also decided to run for systems with $N>56$. This has no scientific significance, other than testing how far a VMC code can go. One thing is that the computations get extremely expensive as the number of particle increases, but also the standard error is assumed to increase due to.. This means that we cannot just crack up the wall clock time and wait when studying large systems, at some point the standard error gets insufficiently large and we need to further increase the number of Monte Carlo cycles. The learning rate also needs to be decreased as the system sizes increase, which requires more iterations.  We look at weakly interacting particles, so we will not get any relativistic effects even when adding many particles.

\section{Double quantum dots}
Double quantum dots are systems that are very interesting when it comes to testing the Boltzmann machines. Even though we know the wave functions for the non-interacting case, they are expansions that are computational expensive to work with.

\subsection{Ground state energy}
For the interacting case, we will use Alocias Mariadason's VMC calculations with and without a Hartree-Fock basis as a reference. In addition, Jørgen Høgberget provides a DMC energy for the case with two particles and $\omega=1.0$. All the results are given in table \eqref{tab:doubleQD}.
\begin{table}
	\caption{Double quantum dots. F is the number of functions used in the expansion.}

What we observe, is that the Boltzmann machine with a Padé-Jastrow factor outperforms a Hermite expansion of 10 functions, which is surprising. The reason might be that the Boltzmann machine consists of a sum over all hidden nodes, which makes it behave similar to an expansion. However, the Boltzmann machine was then again beat by the Hermite expansion with a Hartree-Fock basis.

\section{Atoms}
The next set of systems we will address are the real Atoms, which have been investigated by physicists since the childhood of quantum mechanics. This section is added just to show the flexibility of the implemented code, which easily can be expanded to new systems. We use the simple Hydrogen-like orbitals in our calculations, detailed in section \ref{sec:atomic}. We have looked at the three smallest closed-shell atoms only, namely Helium, Beryllium and Neon.

In table \ref{tab:atomswinteraction} we present the ground state energy of our selected atoms, including an overview of how the energy is distributed. We also compare the obtained results to experimental values found from different papers. What we see, is that the total energy is similar, but slightly higher than our reference, which is as expected as we use a simple basis. 

If we once again recall the virial theorem first introduced in section \ref{sec:virial}, it reads
\begin{equation}
2\langle\hat{T}\rangle = -(\langle\hat{V}_{\text{ext}}\rangle + \langle\hat{V}_{\text{int}}\rangle)
\end{equation}
for atoms and molecules. Our obtained energy distribution agrees with it, and we therefore have a reason to believe that the energies are calculated correctly. 

\begin{table}
	\caption{Energy of neutral atoms of atomic number $Z$. The expected energies were produced by VMC, detailed in the introductory words of this chapter. $a$ is reference to \cite{bergeson_measurement_1998}, $b$ is to \cite{kramida_compilation_1997} and $c$ is to \cite{hogberget_quantum_2013}. The energy is in atomic units.}

	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

Further, we look at the one-body densities, which are done in figure \ref{fig:atomsonebody}. To reveal details, they are multiplied with $r^2$ as for example J.Høgberget has done before us \cite{hogberget_quantum_2013}. We observe that the densities also are similar to his DMC results, which again substantiates that our framework and electron density computations work as they should.
