Typesetting was done using the \LaTeX  document preparation system.

As long as nothing else is specified, the illustrations are creating using the TikZ package \cite{tantau_graph_2013}.

Plotting is done in Matplotlib \cite{hunter_matplotlib:_2007} and PGFPlots \cite{tantau_graph_2013}. 

Effort was made to follow the ISO 80000-2:2009 standard for mathematical signs and symbols \cite{iso/tc_12_iso_nodate}, and the ISO 80000-9:2009 standard for quantities and units in physical chemistry\cite{iso/tc_12_iso_nodate-1}.

5 years at Blindern

Thanks to my excellent high school teacher, Jens Otto Opaker, for getting me hooked on science

Thanks to Morten Hjorth-Jensen for all the help, motivation and believing in me.

Thanks to HÃ¥kon Kristiansen and Alocias Mariadason for answering all my questions and for you patience. 

Thanks to my family for all the support, and my friends who always are there when I need to disconnect from the studies. 

Last, but not least, I would like to say thank you to the Computational Physics group... So many talented guys in the group. 

I have always believed that everything has a reason, which I used to point out whenever people talked about things that could not easily be explained. First when I was introduced to quantum mechanics, I realized that it might not be that simple, which is one of the reasons why this beautiful theory caught my attention. Even though my philosophy has changed to a less deterministic direction, I still like to think that everything can be explained out of some first principles.
