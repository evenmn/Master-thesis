Thanks to Morten Hjorth-Jensen for all the help, motivation and believing in me.

Thanks to HÃ¥kon Emil Kristiansen and Alocias Mariadason for answering all my questions and for you patience. 

Thanks to my family for all the support, and my friends who always are there when I need to disconnect from the studies. 

Last, but not least, I would like to say thank you to the Computational Physics group...

I have always believed that everything has a reason, which I used to point out whenever people talked about things that could not easily be explained. First when I was introduced to quantum mechanics, I realized that it might not be that simple, which is one of the reasons why this beautiful theory caught my attention. Even though my philosophy has changed to a less deterministic direction, I still like to think that everything can be explained out of some first principles.
