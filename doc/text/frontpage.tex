\section*{Acknowledgements}
First of all I would like to thank Christine for cooking delicious food and feeding me when I need it the most. She and her food have maintained my motivation in the best way, and they are the main reason why I've survived those two years of masters. 

Secondly, my annoying cohabitants have forced me to spend more time at university. I'm so glad you behave the way you do, if you were more cozy I would certainly spend more time at home and this thesis would not be the same.

    -One of my mottos used to be that everything has a reason, which I used to point out whenever people were talking about things that apparently could not be described immediately. It was first when I learned about quantum mechanics that I understood I was wrong, and that is one of the reasons why quantum mechanics catched me so hardly.
