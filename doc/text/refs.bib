The technique can be easily extended to study the ground state energies of hydrogen atom, particle in a box, helium atom and other complex microscopic systems involving N particles in d-dimensions.},

Here we demonstrate that systematic machine learning of the wave function can reduce this complexity to a tractable computational form, for some notable cases of physical interest. We introduce a variational representation of quantum states based on artificial neural networks with variable number of hidden neurons. A reinforcement-learning scheme is then demonstrated, capable of either finding the ground-state or describing the unitary time evolution of complex interacting quantum systems. We show that this approach achieves very high accuracy in the description of equilibrium and dynamical properties of prototypical interacting spins models in both one and two dimensions, thus offering a new powerful tool to solve the quantum many-body problem.},

The first three chapters contain introductory material culminating in a thorough discussion of the Hartree-Fock approximation.The remaining four chapters describe a variety of more sophisticated approaches, which improve upon this approximation.Among the highlights of the seven chapters are (1) a review of the mathematics (mostly matrix algebra) required for the rest of the book, (2) an introduction to the basic techniques, ideas, and notations of quantum chemistry, (3) a thorough discussion of the Hartree-Fock approximation, (4) a treatment of configuration interaction (Cl) and approaches incorporating electron correlation, (5) a description of the independent electron pair approximation and a variety of more sophisticated approaches that incorporate coupling between pairs, (6) a consideration of the perturbative approach to the calculation of the correlation energy of many-electron systems and (7) a brief introduction to the use of the one-particle many-body Green's function in quantum chemistry.Over 150 exercises, designed to help the reader acquire a working knowledge of the material, are embedded in the text. The book is largely self-contained and requires no prerequisite other than a solid undergraduate physical chemistry course; however, some exposure to quantum chemistry will enhance the student's appreciation of the material. Clear and well-written, this text is ideal for the second semester of a two-semester course in quantum chemistry, or for a special topics course.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

Reasons for using a naming convention (as opposed to allowing programmers to choose any character sequence) include the following:

To reduce the effort needed to read and understand source code;
To enable code reviews to focus on more important issues than arguing over syntax and naming standards.
To enable code quality review tools to focus their reporting mainly on significant issues other than syntax and style preferences.The choice of naming conventions can be an enormously controversial issue, with partisans of each holding theirs to be the best and others to be inferior. Colloquially, this is said to be a matter of dogma. Many companies have also established their own set of conventions.},

We describe a method for obtaining the numerically exact eigenenergies and eigenstates for such a model, along with the energies obtained through the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation. The exact solution is accessible with elementary mathematics, though numerical solutions are required. We also find that the WKB approximation is remarkably accurate, not just for the ground state, but for the excited states as well.},

The bound exciton ground state locally emits a distinct sharp line. With increasing excitation of this quantum dot level additional transition lines emerge at lower energy. They are attributed to localized biexciton states. The biexciton correlation energy is about 4 meV. A distinct two-photon resonant absorption peak of the biexciton ground state is observed in PL excitation spectroscopy. Its linewidth is only about 30 μeV. The spectra and their polarization properties are discussed on the basis of a discrete level scheme and the Pauli exclusion principle.},

	abstract = {We study the development of electron-electron correlations in circular quantum dots as the density is decreased. We consider a wide range of both electron number, N⩽20, and electron gas parameter, rs≲18, using the diffusion quantum Monte Carlo technique. Features associated with correlation appear to develop very differently in quantum dots than in bulk. The main reason is that translational symmetry is necessarily broken in a dot, leading to density modulation and inhomogeneity. Electron-electron interactions act to enhance this modulation ultimately leading to localization. This process appears to be completely smooth and occurs over a wide range of density. Thus there is a broad regime of “incipient” Wigner crystallization in these quantum dots. Our specific conclusions are (i) the density develops sharp rings while the pair density shows both radial and angular inhomogeneity; (ii) the spin of the ground state is consistent with Hund’s (first) rule throughout our entire range of rs for all 4⩽N⩽20; (iii) the addition energy curve first becomes smoother as interactions strengthen—the mesoscopic fluctuations are damped by correlation—and then starts to show features characteristic of the classical addition energy; (iv) localization effects are stronger for a smaller number of electrons; (v) finally, the gap to certain spin excitations becomes small at the strong interaction (large rs) side of our regime.},

The purpose of this review is to provide an introduction to the core concepts and tools of machine learning in a manner easily understood and intuitive to physicists. The review begins by covering fundamental concepts in ML and modern statistics such as the bias-variance tradeoff, overfitting, regularization, generalization, and gradient descent before moving on to more advanced topics in both supervised and unsupervised learning. Topics covered in the review include ensemble models, deep learning and neural networks, clustering and data visualization, energy-based models (including MaxEnt models and Restricted Boltzmann Machines), and variational methods. Throughout, we emphasize the many natural connections between ML and statistical physics. A notable aspect of the review is the use of Python Jupyter notebooks to introduce modern ML/statistical packages to readers using physics-inspired datasets (the Ising Model and Monte-Carlo simulations of supersymmetric decays of proton-proton collisions). We conclude with an extended outlook discussing possible uses of machine learning for furthering our understanding of the physical world as well as open problems in ML where physicists may be able to contribute.

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

	abstract = {Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is an advanced simulation methodology for studies of manybody quantum systems. In this review, we focus on the electronic structure QMC, i.e., methods relevant for systems described by the electron-ion Hamiltonians. Some of the key QMC achievements include direct treatment of electron correlation, accuracy in predicting energy differences and favorable scaling in the system size. Calculations of atoms, molecules, clusters and solids have demonstrated QMC applicability to real systems with hundreds of electrons while providing 90-95\% of the correlation energy and energy differences typically within a few percent of experiments. Advances in accuracy beyond these limits are hampered by the so-called fixed-node approximation which is used to circumvent the notorious fermion sign problem. Many-body nodes of fermion states and their properties have therefore become one of the important topics for further progress in predictive power and efficiency of QMC calculations. Some of our recent results on the wave function nodes and related nodal domain topologies will be briefly reviewed. This includes analysis of few-electron systems and descriptions of exact and approximate nodes using transformations and projections of the highly-dimensional nodal hypersurfaces into the 3D space. Studies of fermion nodes offer new insights into topological properties of eigenstates such as explicit demonstrations that generic fermionic ground states exhibit the minimal number of two nodal domains. Recently proposed trial wave functions based on Pfaffians with pairing orbitals are presented and their nodal properties are tested in calculations of first row atoms and molecules. Finally, backflow "dressed" coordinates are introduced as another possibility for capturing correlation effects and for decreasing the fixed-node bias.},

We employ so-called reduced Boltzmann machines to construct trial wave func-

variational Monte Carlo calculations, with expectation values like energies and
energy variance being of the same quality. This opens up for several exciting
explorations, in particular since the construction of trial wave functions used in
Monte Carlo calculations is often complicated, both due to specific correlations
and/or the fact that the analytical form of the trial wave function is difficult to
obtain. Our Boltzmann machine trial wave function can easily be used as start-
ing points in Green’s function Monte Carlo calculations. The latter allow for in
principle exact solutions of Schrödinger’s equation.},

	abstract = {The Stochastic Gradient Approximation (SGA) is the natural extension of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods to the variational optimization of quantum wave function parameters. While many deterministic applications impose stochasticity, the SGA fruitfully takes advantage of the natural stochasticity already present in QMC in order to utilize a small number of QMC samples and approach the minimum more quickly by averaging out the random noise in the samples. The increasing efficiency of the method for systems with larger numbers of particles, and its nearly ideal scaling when running on parallelized processors, is evidence that the SGA is well suited for the study of nanoclusters. In this thesis, I discuss the SGA algorithm in detail. I also describe its application to both quantum dots, and to the Resonating Valence Bond wave function (RVB). The RVB is a sophisticated model of electronic systems that captures electronic correlation effects directly and that improves the nodal structure of quantum wave functions. The RVB is receiving renewed attention in the study of nanoclusters due to the fact that calculations of RVB wave functions have become feasible with recent advances in computer hardware and software.},
