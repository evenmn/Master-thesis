Here we demonstrate that systematic machine learning of the wave function can reduce this complexity to a tractable computational form, for some notable cases of physical interest. We introduce a variational representation of quantum states based on artificial neural networks with variable number of hidden neurons. A reinforcement-learning scheme is then demonstrated, capable of either finding the ground-state or describing the unitary time evolution of complex interacting quantum systems. We show that this approach achieves very high accuracy in the description of equilibrium and dynamical properties of prototypical interacting spins models in both one and two dimensions, thus offering a new powerful tool to solve the quantum many-body problem.},

The first three chapters contain introductory material culminating in a thorough discussion of the Hartree-Fock approximation.The remaining four chapters describe a variety of more sophisticated approaches, which improve upon this approximation.Among the highlights of the seven chapters are (1) a review of the mathematics (mostly matrix algebra) required for the rest of the book, (2) an introduction to the basic techniques, ideas, and notations of quantum chemistry, (3) a thorough discussion of the Hartree-Fock approximation, (4) a treatment of configuration interaction (Cl) and approaches incorporating electron correlation, (5) a description of the independent electron pair approximation and a variety of more sophisticated approaches that incorporate coupling between pairs, (6) a consideration of the perturbative approach to the calculation of the correlation energy of many-electron systems and (7) a brief introduction to the use of the one-particle many-body Green's function in quantum chemistry.Over 150 exercises, designed to help the reader acquire a working knowledge of the material, are embedded in the text. The book is largely self-contained and requires no prerequisite other than a solid undergraduate physical chemistry course; however, some exposure to quantum chemistry will enhance the student's appreciation of the material. Clear and well-written, this text is ideal for the second semester of a two-semester course in quantum chemistry, or for a special topics course.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

To reduce the effort needed to read and understand source code;
To enable code reviews to focus on more important issues than arguing over syntax and naming standards.
To enable code quality review tools to focus their reporting mainly on significant issues other than syntax and style preferences.The choice of naming conventions can be an enormously controversial issue, with partisans of each holding theirs to be the best and others to be inferior. Colloquially, this is said to be a matter of dogma. Many companies have also established their own set of conventions.},

We describe a method for obtaining the numerically exact eigenenergies and eigenstates for such a model, along with the energies obtained through the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation. The exact solution is accessible with elementary mathematics, though numerical solutions are required. We also find that the WKB approximation is remarkably accurate, not just for the ground state, but for the excited states as well.},

Through the reduction of the number of emitting dots in small mesa structures, we evidence narrow lines in the spectra, each associated with a single InAs dot. Beyond the statistical analysis allowed by this technique, our results indicate short capture and relaxation times into the dots. This approach opens the route towards the detailed optical study of high quality easily fabricated single semiconductor quantum dots.},

	abstract = {Using a micron-sized photoluminescence (PL) probe enables us to study single islandlike interface defects of a thin GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well. The bound exciton ground state locally emits a distinct sharp line. With increasing excitation of this quantum dot level additional transition lines emerge at lower energy. They are attributed to localized biexciton states. The biexciton correlation energy is about 4 meV. A distinct two-photon resonant absorption peak of the biexciton ground state is observed in PL excitation spectroscopy. Its linewidth is only about 30 μeV. The spectra and their polarization properties are discussed on the basis of a discrete level scheme and the Pauli exclusion principle.},

	abstract = {We study the development of electron-electron correlations in circular quantum dots as the density is decreased. We consider a wide range of both electron number, N⩽20, and electron gas parameter, rs≲18, using the diffusion quantum Monte Carlo technique. Features associated with correlation appear to develop very differently in quantum dots than in bulk. The main reason is that translational symmetry is necessarily broken in a dot, leading to density modulation and inhomogeneity. Electron-electron interactions act to enhance this modulation ultimately leading to localization. This process appears to be completely smooth and occurs over a wide range of density. Thus there is a broad regime of “incipient” Wigner crystallization in these quantum dots. Our specific conclusions are (i) the density develops sharp rings while the pair density shows both radial and angular inhomogeneity; (ii) the spin of the ground state is consistent with Hund’s (first) rule throughout our entire range of rs for all 4⩽N⩽20; (iii) the addition energy curve first becomes smoother as interactions strengthen—the mesoscopic fluctuations are damped by correlation—and then starts to show features characteristic of the classical addition energy; (iv) localization effects are stronger for a smaller number of electrons; (v) finally, the gap to certain spin excitations becomes small at the strong interaction (large rs) side of our regime.},
