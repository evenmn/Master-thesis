In order to provide a better understanding of this technique, a pre-requisite concept of Monte Carlo integration is also discussed along with numerical examples. The technique can be easily extended to study the ground state energies of hydrogen atom, particle in a box, helium atom and other complex microscopic systems involving N particles in d-dimensions.},

	abstract = {The challenge posed by the many-body problem in quantum physics originates from the difficulty of describing the non-trivial correlations encoded in the exponential complexity of the many-body wave function. Here we demonstrate that systematic machine learning of the wave function can reduce this complexity to a tractable computational form, for some notable cases of physical interest. We introduce a variational representation of quantum states based on artificial neural networks with variable number of hidden neurons. A reinforcement-learning scheme is then demonstrated, capable of either finding the ground-state or describing the unitary time evolution of complex interacting quantum systems. We show that this approach achieves very high accuracy in the description of equilibrium and dynamical properties of prototypical interacting spins models in both one and two dimensions, thus offering a new powerful tool to solve the quantum many-body problem.},

	shorttitle = {Modern {Quantum} {Chemistry}},
	abstract = {The aim of this graduate-level textbook is to present and explain, at other than a superficial level, modem ab initio approaches to the calculation of the electronic structure and properties of molecules. The first three chapters contain introductory material culminating in a thorough discussion of the Hartree-Fock approximation.The remaining four chapters describe a variety of more sophisticated approaches, which improve upon this approximation.Among the highlights of the seven chapters are (1) a review of the mathematics (mostly matrix algebra) required for the rest of the book, (2) an introduction to the basic techniques, ideas, and notations of quantum chemistry, (3) a thorough discussion of the Hartree-Fock approximation, (4) a treatment of configuration interaction (Cl) and approaches incorporating electron correlation, (5) a description of the independent electron pair approximation and a variety of more sophisticated approaches that incorporate coupling between pairs, (6) a consideration of the perturbative approach to the calculation of the correlation energy of many-electron systems and (7) a brief introduction to the use of the one-particle many-body Green's function in quantum chemistry.Over 150 exercises, designed to help the reader acquire a working knowledge of the material, are embedded in the text. The book is largely self-contained and requires no prerequisite other than a solid undergraduate physical chemistry course; however, some exposure to quantum chemistry will enhance the student's appreciation of the material. Clear and well-written, this text is ideal for the second semester of a two-semester course in quantum chemistry, or for a special topics course.},
