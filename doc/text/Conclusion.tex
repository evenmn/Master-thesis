\chapter{Conclusion and future work} \label{sec:conclusion}
See if machine learning is able to describe the three-body interaction, with nuclear physics applications. 

Run linear algebra operations on GPU, we only tried CPU. 

In-medium

Multi-quantum dot to compare to experiments

If we go back to the goals presented in the introduction, we can see that most of them are met. However, we did not have time or manage to study atoms using Boltzmann machines as it is not obvious to me how to do that.
