\chapter{Conclusion and future work} \label{sec:conclusion}
The idea behind the simple Jastrow factor, was that it is not optimized with respect to the interactions and thus represents an attempt of reducing the physical intuition used. It turned out that the simple Jastrow did not work very well compare to the Pad√©-Jastrow factor and when it more expensive as well, there is actually no point of using the simple Jastrow factor. 

See if machine learning is able to describe the three-body interaction, with nuclear physics applications. 

Run linear algebra operations on GPU, we only tried CPU. 

In-medium

Multi-quantum dot to compare to experiments

If we go back to the goals presented in the introduction, we can see that most of them are met. However, we did not have time or manage to study atoms using Boltzmann machines as it is not obvious to me how to do that. 

Better to look at densities to reveal differences.
