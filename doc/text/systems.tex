In quantum physics, as in classical physics, there are many different systems with various complexities. If a system gets very complex, it is often beneficial to approximate it with a simpler system which hopefully catches the most important features in the system. This is especially advantageous in quantum mechanics, as only a few systems can be solved analytically. We have already seen that the atomic system can be solved analytically for the non-interacting case, and additionally harmonic systems can be solved analytically. Our circular quantum dots have a confinement represented by the harmonic potential, and for non-interacting quantum dots we can thus also find analytical expressions. 

We will in this chapter set up the explicit expressions of the Hamiltonians and single-particle functions for various quantum mechanical systems. Albeit the quantum dots will be investigated in the first place, it is natural to include a brief discussion of the atom as there are many common features between the systems. Also double quantum dots will be covered, as one can find analytical solutions by an expansion of single quantum dot functions.

\section{Quantum dots} \label{sec:quantumdots}
The harmonic oscillator is often the first system that one is introduced to when attending an introduction course to quantum mechanics, for several reasons. Firstly, many systems can be approximated with the harmonic oscillator potential, including our circular quantum dots. Secondly, the harmonic oscillator behaves nicely and has neat equations for the non-interacting case. 

Quantum dots are very small particles, and consist of fermions or bosons hold together by an external potential which is not created by a nucleus. Similar to atoms, these dots have discrete electronic states with a well-defined shell structure, and are therefore often called artificial atoms. In this thesis we will study circular quantum dots with electrons affected by a harmonic oscillator potential. For an electron $i$, the potential reads
\begin{equation}
V_i(r)=\frac{1}{2}m\omega^2r_i^2,
\end{equation}
where $m$ is the electron mass, $\omega$ is the oscillator frequency and $r_i$ is the relative distance from particle $i$ to the center of the dot. Using natural units as described in Appendix B, we can write the Hamiltonian as
\begin{empheq}[box={\mybluebox[5pt]}]{equation}
\label{eq:HOHamiltonian}
\hat{\mathcal{H}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \Big(-\frac{1}{2} \nabla_i^2 + \frac{1}{2} \omega^2r_i ^2\Big) + \sum_{i<j} \frac{1}{r_{ij}} 
\end{empheq}
where the energy is given in Hartrees and the lengths are scaled with respect to $\sqrt{\hbar/m}$.

The exact solutions of the non-interacting Hamiltonian are the Hermite functions, 
\begin{equation}
\phi_n(x)=H_n(\sqrt{\omega}x)\exp(-\omega x^2/2)
\end{equation}
which are natural choices of single particle functions also for systems with interaction. $H_n(x)$ is the Hermite polynomial of $n$'th degree, and the first four Hermite functions are illustrated in figure \eqref{fig:harmonicoscillator}. The energy of a particle with principal quantum number $n$ in a certain dimension is given by
\begin{equation}
E_n=\omega\Big(n+\frac{1}{2}\Big)\quad\quad\forall\quad n\in\{0,1,2...\}
\label{eq:HOenergies}
\end{equation}
where we in multi-dimensional potentials need to summarize the contribution from all the dimensions.

We will study closed-shell systems only, since the Slater determinant in that case is unambiguous. \iffalse For open shells, the total Slater determinant is a linear combination of all the possible Slater determinants, and one can for instance use . \fi The number of particles in closed-shell systems are called magic numbers, which in two dimensions are $N=2,6,12,\hdots$. In general, the magic numbers are given by
\begin{equation}
N=s\binom{n+D}{D} \quad\quad\forall\quad n\in\{0,1,2...\}
\label{eq:HOclosedshell}
\end{equation}
where $s$ is the number of spin configurations (2), $n$ is the principal quantum number and $D$ is the number of dimensions. This is a direct consequence of the Pauli principle, where we in the ground state can have two particles with spatial wave functions $\phi_{n_x=0,n_y=0}$, in the next energy level we can have 4 particles with spatial wave functions $\phi_{n_x=1,n_y=0}$ and $\phi_{n_x=0,n_y=1}$ with degeneracy 2 and so on. See figure \eqref{fig:hostates} for a schematic of the first few states in a two-dimensional quantum dot.

\section{Quantum double dots} \label{sec:doubledots}
Another historically important quantum system is the double dot, which similarly to the single dot can be solved analytically. For the same reason as the single dot often is called an artificial atom, the double dots are called artificial molecules. 

The potential of symmetrical quantum dots can in principle have a variety of different shapes, but the most used one-dimensional potentials can be derived from
\begin{equation}
V_i(x)=\frac{1}{2}\omega^2\bigg[|x_i|^a-\Big(\frac{b}{2}\Big)^a\bigg]^2
\label{eq:doublewell}
\end{equation}
with $b$ as the distance between the bottoms of the wells and $a$ as an arbitrary integer \cite{jelic_double_2012}. Setting $a=1$ gives two parabolic wells with a sharp local maximum at $x=0$, while $a=2$ gives a smoother but steeper well. In figure \eqref{fig:doublewell} the potential is plotted for $a=1,2$ and $3$.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{pgf/doublewell.tex}
	\caption{One-dimensional double-well potentials plotted with $a=1,2$ and 3, and $b=2$. For $a=1$ the potential was multiplied with 2 to make it comparable to the others. }
	\label{fig:doublewell}
\end{figure}

For reference and benchmark purposes, we will focus on the case with $a=1$ and $b=2$, which can be written out as
\begin{equation}
V_i(x)=\frac{1}{2}\omega^2\bigg[x_i^2+\frac{1}{4}b^2-b|x_i|\bigg],
\label{eq:doublewell2}
\end{equation}
still in one dimension. For more than one dimension, we assume that the double dot expands in the $x$-direction, which gives us the general expression
\begin{equation}
V_i^{\text{DW}}=\frac{1}{2}\omega^2\bigg[r_i^2+\frac{1}{4}b^2-b|x_i|\bigg]=V_i^{\text{HO}}+\frac{1}{2}\omega^2\bigg[\frac{1}{4}b^2-b|x_i|\bigg]
\label{eq:doublewell3}
\end{equation}
where HO means harmonic oscillator potential and DW means double-well potential. What we actually observe, is that the potential separates in a single-dot part and a double-dot part, which makes the double-dot Hamiltonian similar to the single-dot Hamiltonian,
\begin{empheq}[box={\mybluebox[5pt]}]{equation}
\label{eq:DWHamiltonian}
\hat{\mathcal{H}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \bigg(-\frac{1}{2} \nabla_i^2 + \frac{1}{2} \omega^2r_i ^2 + \frac{1}{2} \omega^2\Big(\frac{1}{4}b^2-b|x_i|\Big)\bigg) + \sum_{i<j} \frac{1}{r_{ij}}.
\end{empheq}

What is remaining is to find an appropriate set of single-particle functions. Based on the observations above, a reasonable set should be similar to the Hermite functions which we found to be the analytical single-particle functions of the single dot. For that reason, we will use the single-particle functions 
\begin{equation}
\ket{\phi_n^{\text{DW}}(x)}=\sum_{\lambda=1}^{L}C_{n\lambda}\ket{\phi_{\lambda}^{\text{HO}}(x)},
\end{equation}
where $L\in[1,\infty\rangle$ is the number of basis functions used and $C_{n\lambda}$ is the coefficient associated with the double-dot function $n$ and the single-dot function $\lambda$, which is what we want to find. Inserting this into the double-dot SchrÃ¶dinger equation and multiplying with $\bra{\phi_{\nu}^{\text{HO}}(x)}$ on the left-hand-side gives
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:doublewellsums}
\sum_{\lambda=1}^LC_{n\lambda}\mel{\phi_{\nu}^{\text{HO}}(x)}{\hat{\mathcal{H}}_{\text{DW}}}{\phi_{\lambda}^{\text{HO}}(x)}=\epsilon_n\sum_{\lambda=1}^LC_{n\lambda}\braket{\phi_{\nu}^{\text{HO}}(x)}{\phi_{\lambda}^{\text{HO}}(x)}
\end{equation}
where the right-hand-side sum collapses because the overlap is just the Kronecker delta, $\braket{\phi_{\nu}^{\text{HO}}(x)}{\phi_{\lambda}^{\text{HO}}(x)}=\delta_{\nu\lambda}$. By defining the matrix elements
\begin{equation}
\hat{h}_{\nu\lambda}\equiv\mel{\phi_{\nu}^{\text{HO}}(x)}{\hat{\mathcal{H}}_{\text{DW}}}{\phi_{\lambda}^{\text{HO}}(x)},
\end{equation}
we can set up equation \eqref{eq:doublewellsums} as an eigenvalue problem in the form of
\begin{equation}
\hat{h}\hat{C}=\epsilon\hat{C}
\end{equation}
where our targets, $\hat{C}$, are just the eigenvectors of the $\hat{h}$-matrix. Now recall that the double dot Hamiltonian is just an extension of the single dot Hamiltonian, such that we can rewrite
\begin{equation}
\hat{h}_{\nu\lambda}=\mel{\phi_{\nu}^{\text{HO}}(x)}{\hat{\mathcal{H}}_{\text{HO}}}{\phi_{\lambda}^{\text{HO}}(x)}+\mel{\phi_{\nu}^{\text{HO}}(x)}{\hat{\mathcal{H}}_{\text{+}}}{\phi_{\lambda}^{\text{HO}}(x)}
\end{equation}
with $\hat{\mathcal{H}}_{\text{+}}=(1/2)\omega\sum_{i=1}^N\Big((1/4)b^2-b|x_i|\Big)$ as the extension. The former integrals are just the harmonic oscillator energies, presented in \eqref{eq:HOenergies}, while the latter integrals are trivial to calculate. However, since we need to calculate a relatively large number of matrix elements, we decided to do it using numerical integration on the computer. The script doing this is given the creative name \lstinline|doublewell_functions.py|, found on \url{http://www.github.com/evenmn/VMC/scripts}.

\section{Atoms} \label{sec:atomic}
Although we will focus on quantum dots in this work, atoms are relevant as they behave similar to quantum dots and can be studied with the same code framework with few modifications. When defining the atomic Hamiltonian, one often freezes out the nucleonic degrees of freedom known as the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The electrons will in fact affect the nucleus, but due to the mass difference this effect is negligible.

We again have Coulomb interaction between the electrons and the nucleus, and since we assume the latter to be at rest at the origin, the external potential affecting particle $i$ is
\begin{equation}
V_i(r)=- \frac{1}{2} k_e\frac{Ze^2}{r_i},
\end{equation}
where $Z$ is the atomic number (number of protons in the nucleus). The total Hamiltonian is given in (Hartree) atomic units, 
\begin{empheq}[box={\mybluebox[5pt]}]{equation}
\label{eq:AtomicHamiltonian}
\hat{\mathcal{H}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \Big(-\frac{1}{2} \nabla_i^2 - \frac{Z}{r_i}\Big) + \sum_{i<j} \frac{1}{r_{ij}},
\end{empheq}
which also is discussed in Appendix B. For the non-interacting case, the energy of a particle in shell $n$ is given by the Bohr formula
\begin{equation}
E_n=-\frac{Z^2}{2n^2},
\label{eq:bohrformula}
\end{equation}
which means that to find the binding energy of an atom, we need to summarize the energy of all the electrons. 

Also for this system, we need to specify a basis set to use. For atoms where the electrons do not interact, the wave functions are given by the \textit{Hydrogen-like orbitals}, which in spherical coordinates can be split in a radial part and an angular part,
\begin{equation}
\psi_{nlm_l}(r,\theta,\phi)=R_{nl}(r)Y_l^{m_l}(\theta,\phi).
\label{eq:hydrogenlike}
\end{equation}
where $n$ again is the principal quantum number, $l$ is the angular quantum number and $m_l$ is the magnetic quantum number. Henceforth $m_l$ will simply be displayed as $m$ to make the expressions neater. Since we are physicists, we use $\theta$ as the polar angle and $\phi$ as the azimuthal angle.

The radial part can be presented as a function of the \textit{associated Laguerre polynomials} or \textit{generalized Laguerre polynomials}, $L_{q}^p(x)$ and the Hydrogen wave function presented in section \ref{sec:hydrogen}, and reads
\begin{equation}
R_{nl}(r)\propto r^le^{-Zr/n}\Big[L_{n-l-1}^{2l+1}\Big(\frac{2r}{n}Z\Big)\Big].
\end{equation}
The angular part is given by the \textit{spherical harmonics},
\begin{equation}
Y_l^m(\theta,\phi)\propto P_l^m(\cos\theta)e^{im\phi}
\end{equation}
where $P_l^m(x)$ are the \textit{associated Legendre polynomials}. The complex part in the spherical harmonics can be avoided by introducing the real solid harmonics instead
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:V_ext}
S_l^m(\theta,\phi)\propto P_l^{|m|}(\cos\theta)
\begin{cases} 
\cos(m\phi) & \text{if} \quad m\geq0 \\
\sin(|m|\phi) & \text{if} \quad m<0,
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
such that
\begin{equation}
\psi_{nlm}(r,\theta,\phi)= R_{nl}(r)S_l^m(\theta,\phi).
\label{eq:hydrogenlikesolid}
\end{equation}
The real solid harmonics do not alter any physical quantities that are degenerate in the subspace consisting of opposite magnetic quantum numbers, and for that reason they will give the same energies as the spherical harmonics as long as there is no magnetic field present \cite{morten_hjorth-jensen_computational_2019}.

For atomic systems it is also common to use a Hartree-Fock basis, based on Gaussian functions as discussed in section \ref{sec:basisset}. Actually, more or less all electronic structure studies of atoms nowadays use these expansions, as they provide very precise results and high performance due to the evaluation properties of the Gaussian functions. Even though the Gaussian functions do not have the correct shape, an expansion can be fitted pretty well \cite{hehre_selfconsistent_1969}.

As for the quantum dot systems we will study closed shells only, but for atoms we will introduce subshells as well which are dependent on $l$ and $m$ in addition to the principal quantum number $n$. Traditionally, the first few subshells are denoted by $s, p, d$ and $f$, and the meaning can be found in table \eqref{tab:subshells}, together with number of electrons in each subshell.

\begin{table} [H]
	\caption{Degeneracy and naming conversations of the first subshells.  \vspace{2mm}}
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{X|X:X:X} \hline\hline
		\label{tab:subshells}
		Subshell label & $l$ & Max electrons & Name \\ \hline
		$s$ & 0 & 2 & sharp\\ 
		$p$ & 1 & 6 & principal\\
		$d$ & 2 & 10 & diffuse \\
		$f$ & 3 & 14 & fundamental \\
		$g$ & 4 & 18 & \textit{alphabetic hereafter} \\ \hline\hline
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

For Helium, we have two electrons with $n=1$, which means that both have $l=0$ and both electrons are in the $s$-subshell, or the so-called $s$-wave. We can thus write the electron configuration as $1s^2$. 

Similarly to the principal quantum number $n$, we can use the rule of tumble that the lower $l$ the lower energy, such that for Beryllium all four electrons are still in the $s$-subshell. Beryllium therefore has electron configuration $1s^2 2s^2$ or [He] $2s^2$. Since both subshells are fully occupied, Beryllium can be included in our closed-shell calculations. 

If we continue with the same rules, we see that the next closed-shell atom has a fully occupied $p$-subshell as well, which is Neon with 10 electrons. This is a noble gas, and we can write the electron configuration as [Be] $2p^6$. All noble gases have endings $Xs^2 Xp^6$, which is the reason why they always have 8 valence electrons.

We can now compare this to the periodic table, and observe that the first two rows agree with the theory presented above: The first row has two elements and the second has eight. However, the third one also has eight elements, which does not fit our theory. It must be something we have overlooked. 

The reason is that the angular momentum contribution is not taken into account, i.e., we need to include the Hamiltonian term
\begin{equation}
V_L=\frac{l(l+1)}{2r^2}
\end{equation}
as well. If we do so, we see that the rule of thumb defined above not always holds. Sometimes a low $l$ in a higher $n$ causes lower energy than a high $l$ in a lower $n$.
