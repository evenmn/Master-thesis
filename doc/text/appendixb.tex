\subsection{Harmonic Oscillator - Natural units}
Hamiltonian is in one dimension given by
\begin{equation}
H=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+\frac{1}{2}m\omega^2x^2
\label{eq:HamiltonianHO}
\end{equation}
which has corresponding wavefunctions
\begin{equation}
\psi_n(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^nn!}}\cdot\bigg(\frac{m\omega}{\pi\hbar}\bigg)^{1/4}\exp\Big(-\frac{m\omega}{2\hbar}x^2\Big)H_n\Big(\sqrt{\frac{m\omega}{\hbar}}x\Big).
\end{equation}
We want to get rid of $\hbar$ and $m$ in equation \eqref{eq:HamiltonianHO}, and we start with scaling $H'\equiv H/\hbar$, such that the Hamiltonian reduces to
\begin{equation}
H'=-\frac{\hbar}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{m\omega^2}{\hbar}x^2
\end{equation}
One can now observe that the fraction $\hbar/m$ comes in both terms, which we can take out by scaling the length $x'\equiv x\cdot\sqrt{m/\hbar}$. The final Hamiltonian is
\begin{equation}
H=\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+\frac{1}{2}\omega^2x^2
\end{equation}
which corresponds to setting $\hbar=m=1$. In natural units, one often sets $\omega=1$ as well by scaling $H'=H/\hbar\omega$, but since we want to keep the $\omega$-dependency, we do it slightly different. This means that the exact wavefunctions for the one-particle-one-dimension case is
\begin{equation}
\psi_n(x)=\exp\Big(-\frac{\omega}{2}x^2\Big)H_n(\sqrt{\omega}x)
\end{equation}
where we take advantage of the Metropolis algorithm and ignore the normalization constant.
