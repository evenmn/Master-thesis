Parameter estimation is a large part of science, because we are often not able to measure things directly. For instance, when Millikan in ... performed his famous electron charge experiment or when we estimate Sun's mass.

The use of the term \textit{machine learning} has exploded over the past years, and sometimes it sounds like it is a totally new field. However, the truth is that many of the methods are relatively old, where for instance \textit{linear regression} was known early in the 19th century. \cite{legendre_nouvelles_1805, gauss_theoria_1809} Those methods have just recently been taken under the machine learning umbrella, which is one of the reasons why the term is used more frequently than before. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed, which in facts covers regression and classification. This has made machine learning an extremely rich field. 

Unlike traditional algorithms, machine learning algorithms are not told what to do directly, but they use optimization tools to reproduce targets in the best way. As a consequence, we often do not know exactly what the algorithm does and why it behaves as is does, and because of this behavior, the processing is often called artificial intelligence. In our search for a technique to solve quantum mechanical problems where less physical intuition is needed, machine learning appears as a natural tool.

The increasing popularity should also without any doubt be attributed to the dramatically improvement of a majority of the machine learning algorithms. Perhaps the most important contribution to this came in 2012, when the deep convolution neural network (CNN) \textbf{AlexNet} managed to classify 1.2 millions images into 1000 classes with a remarkable top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%. \cite{krizhevsky_imagenet_2012} Today, the CNNs have been further improved, and they are even able to beat humans in recognizing images! (The history began from AlexNet) Also voice recognition algorithms have lately been revolutionized, thanks to recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and especially long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Their ability to recognize sequential (time-dependent) data made the technology good enough for an entry to millions of peoples everyday-life through services such as \textbf{Google Translate} \cite{wu_googles_2016}, \textbf{Apple Siri} \cite{smith_ios_2016} and \textbf{Amazon Alexa} \cite{noauthor_bringing_nodate}. It is also interesting to see how machine learning has made computers eminent tacticians using recurrent neural networks. The \textbf{Google DeepMind} developed program \textbf{AlphaGo} demonstrated this by beating the 9-dan professional L. Sedol in the board game Go \cite{noauthor_alphago_nodate}, before an improved version, \textbf{AlphaZero}, beat the at that time highest rated chess computer, \textbf{StockFish} \cite{klein_mikeklein_googles_nodate}. Both these scenarios were unbelievable just a decade ago.

Even though all these branches are both exciting and promising, they will not be discussed further in this work, since they will simply not work for our purposes. The reason is that they initially require a data set with known outputs in order to be trained, they obey so-called \textit{supervised} learning. Instead, we rely on \textit{unsupervised} learning, which has the task of finding patterns in the data and is therefore not in need for known outputs. However, we will discuss some simpler supervised learning algorithms as an introduction and a motivation for the unsupervised learning section. But first, let us start with the fundamentals. 

\section{Supervised learning}
As hinted above, in machine learning we want to fit a model to a data set in the best possible way. In supervised learning, we have prior knowledge about what kind of results the model should give in some specific cases, which we can use to train our model. After training, we want the model to
\begin{enumerate}
	\item be able to reproduce the \textit{targets} (the prior known results)
	\item be able to fit future observations.
\end{enumerate}
In this section we will take a closer look at how to find a model which satisfies both these goals. If the first one is satisfied, the second is not necessarily satisfied. Let us first look at polynomial regression. 

\subsection{Polynomial regression}
Polynomial regression is perhaps the most intuitive example on this, where we want to find the line that fits some data points in the best possible way. In two dimensions, the data set consists of some $n$ number of x- and y coordinates,
\begin{align*}
\bs{x}&=(x_1,x_2,\hdots,x_n)\\
\bs{y}&=(y_1,y_2,\hdots,y_n)
\end{align*}
which we for instance could try to fit to a second order polynomial,
\begin{equation}
f(x)=ax^2+bx+c,
\end{equation}
where the parameters $a$, $b$ and $c$ are our estimators. The polynomial is now our model. By inserting the $x$-values into the polynomial, we obtain a set of equations
\begin{equation}
\mqty{
	\tilde{y}_1&=&ax_1^2&+&bx_1&+&c\\
	\tilde{y}_2&=&ax_2^2&+&bx_2&+&c\\
	\vdots&&\vdots&&\vdots&&\vdots\\
	\tilde{y}_n&=&ax_n^2&+&bx_n&+&c
}
\label{eq:lineareqs}
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{y}_i=f(x_i)$ is the $y$-value of the polynomial at $x=x_i$. What we want to do is to determine the estimators $a$, $b$ and $c$ such that the mean squared error (MSE) of all these equations is minimized,
\begin{equation}
\min_{a,b,c}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(y_i-f(x_i;a.b.c))^2.
\end{equation}
There are several ways to do this, but they all are based on the \textit{cost function} (also called the loss function), which can simply be defined as the MSE
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{C}(a,b,c)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\Big(y_i-(ax_i^2+bx_i+c)\Big)^2
\end{equation}
and which we seek to minimize. Before we start minimizing this, we will introduce a more general notation, where the estimators are collected in a column vector 
\begin{equation*}
\bs{\beta}=(a,b,c)^T
\end{equation*}
and the $x_i^j$'s also are collected in a row vector
\begin{equation*}
\bs{X}_i=(x_i^2, x_i, 1).
\end{equation*}
Using this, the cost function can be written as
\begin{align}
\mathcal{C}(\bs{\beta})&=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\Big(y_i-\sum_{j=0}^2X_{ij}\beta_j\Big)^2\notag\\
&=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\Big(y_i-\bs{X}_i\bs{\beta}\Big)^2\label{eq:costols}\\
&=(\bs{y}-\bs{X}\bs{\beta})^T(\bs{y}-\bs{X}\bs{\beta})\notag
\end{align}
where we in the last step have collected all the vectors $\bs{X}_i$ in a matrix. As the minimum of the cost function with respect to a estimator $\beta_j$ is found when the derivative is zero, we need to solve
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{C}(\bs{\beta})}{\partial\beta_j} &=\frac{\partial}{\partial\beta_j}\bigg(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\Big(y_i-\sum_{j=0}^2X_{ij}\beta_j\Big)^2\bigg)\notag\label{eq:gh}\\
&=2\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}X_{ij}\Big(y_i-\sum_{j=0}^2X_{ij}\beta_j\Big)=0.
\end{align*}
We can go further and write it on matrix-vector form as
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{C}(\bs{\beta})}{\partial\bs{\beta}}=2\bs{X}^T(\bs{y}-\bs{X}\bs{\beta})=0
\end{equation*}
where differentiating with respect to a vector here means that each component is $\partial\mathcal{C(\bs{\beta})}/\partial\beta_j$. This is satisfied if
\begin{equation}
\bs{\beta}=(\bs{X}^T\bs{X})^{-1}\bs{X}^T\bs{y}
\label{eq:polynomialestimators}
\end{equation}
which is the equation we seek to solve to find the best fitting polynomial. Before we proceed to the general case, let us have a quick look at an example.
git
\subsubsection{Example}
In this example, we will see how we in practice fit a polynomial to a data set. Suppose we have a tiny data set consisting of 10 points
\begin{align*}
\bs{x}&=(1,2,4,6,7,9,10,11,13,16)\\
\bs{y}&=(15,30,50,60,65,63,60,55,40,0)
\label{eq:datapoints}
\end{align*}
in a plane, which we want to fit a polynomial of degree $p$ to. The data points can be seen in figure (\ref{fig:polynomials} a). The first thing we need to realize, is that in order to validate our models, we cannot use all points for the training. There is no strict rules on how much of the data set that should be used for training and validation, but at least the training data set should be larger than the validation data set. For this particular problem, we decide to leave out $\{(1,15),(9,63),(10,60)\}$ from the training, which we later will use for validation.

Furthermore, we use equation \eqref{eq:polynomialestimators} to find the best fitting first-, second- and sixth order polynomials, and obtain the functions presented in table \eqref{tab:example} with the respective training and validation errors. The polynomials are also plotted in figure (\ref{fig:polynomials} b) together with the actual data points.

\begin{figure}

	\caption{Figure (a) presents the data points given in \eqref{eq:datapoints}, while the figure (b) illustrates how a first-, second- and third order polynomial can be fitted to the training set in the best possible way.}%
	\label{fig:polynomials}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}
	\caption{Best fitting polynomials of 1st, 2nd and 6th order degree to the data set in equation \eqref{eq:datapoints}. $f(x)$ gives the actual form of the polynomial, the training error gives the MSE to the training data set and the prediction error gives the MSE to the validation set.}
	\label{tab:example}
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{llXXX} \hline\hline
		Order & \makecell{\\ \phantom{=}} & $f(x)$ & Training error & Prediction error \\ \hline \\
		
		1st && $-2.14x+60.87$ & 327.22 & 927.87 \\
		2nd && $-x^2+15.74x + 2.51$ & 0.47 & 2.04 \\
		6th && $-0.001x^6+0.04x^5-0.90x^4+9.04x^3-47.52x^2+129.74x-98.67$ & 2.54E-11 & 187.53 \\ \hline\hline
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

What we immediately observe, is that the more complex model (higher degree polynomial) the lower training error. In fact, the polynomial of sixth order reproduces the points perfectly. The first order polynomial is quite bad, while the second order polynomial is intermediate.

However, what really makes sense is the prediction error, and for that we can see that the sixth order polynomial has a terrible performance. When a model can reproduce the training set very well, but is not able to reproduce the training set, we say that it overfits the data set. This means that the model is too complex for the purpose.

On the other hand, we see that the first order polynomial has also a large prediction error, which means that it is not able to reproduce the validation set either. We say that it is underfitted, and we are in need of a more complex model.

Finally, we have the second order polynomial, which is miles ahead its competitors when it comes to prediction error. It turns out that the second order model has an appropriate complexity, which we could have guess in advance.

The natural question now is \textit{"How do we find a correct model complexity?"}. The answer is that one should try various complexities and calculate the prediction error for each model. To find the prediction error precisely, the standard is to use $K$ cross-validation resampling, which tries $K$ choices of validation set to make the most use of our data. More about resampling analysis can be found in section \eqref{sec:resampling}. A deeper understanding of the prediction error will hopefully be gained in the next section, on bias-variance decomposition. 

\subsection{Bias-variance decomposition}
Up to this point, we have skipped some important terms in the statistics. First, we have the \textit{bias}, which can be seen as the absolute error between the predictions and the targets,
\begin{equation*}
\text{bias}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^n(y_i-\tilde{y}_i),
\end{equation*}
which describes the best our model could do if we had an infinite amount of training data. We also have the \textit{variance}, which is given by 
...
So, should we seek to minimize the bias or the variance? This is a good question without any definitely correct answer. If we minimize the bias, the variance will explode and vice versa, so a better solution would be minimizing non of them. In other words, we need to do a trade-off between the bias and the variance known as the bias-variance trade-off. In figure \eqref{fig:bias_variance} 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\subfloat[Illustration of bias and variance]{{\includegraphics[width=8cm]{Images/bias_variance.png}}}
	\subfloat[Bias-variance trade-off]{{\includegraphics[width=8cm]{Images/bias_variance_tradeoff.png} }}
	\caption{Bias-variance}%
	\label{fig:bias_variance}
\end{figure}

The bias is reduced as a function of the complexity, but the variance tends to get higher as the complexity of the model is increased. For that reason, a very complex model is not guaranteed to provide a small error, but instead we need to find the trade-off between how expressive our model class is and how sensitive the fitted model is to sample fluctuations in the training data. This is known as the bias-variance trade-off, and is illustrated in figure \eqref{fig:bias_variance_tradeoff}.

However, as Mehta et.al. notice, this is not necessarily a trade-off; we could both have a high variance and a high bias, and perhaps a more appropriate term would be bias-variance decomposition since the error can be decomposed into a bias part and a variance part. \cite{mehta_high-bias_2019} This decomposition is given by
\begin{equation}
E_{out}=bias^2+\sigma^2.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Linear regression}
Polynomial regression, as already discussed, is an example on a linear regression method, and was meant as motivation before we study linear regression in general. Instead of fitting a polynomials to a set of points, we can fit a general function on the form
\begin{equation}
f(x_i)=\sum_{j=0}^pX_{ij}(x_i)\beta_j
\label{eq:targets}
\end{equation}
where we have $p$ estimators $\beta_j$. The matrix $\bs{X}$ is called the \textit{design matrix}, and the case where $X_{ij}(x_i)=x_i^j$ corresponds to polynomial regression, but it can in principle be an arbitrary function of $x_i$.

The cost function for \textit{the ordinary least square regression} (OLS) case is already found in equation \eqref{eq:costols}, and we can recall it as
\begin{empheq}[box={\mybluebox[5pt]}]{equation}
	\mathcal{C}(\bs{\beta})=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\Big(y_i-\sum_{j=0}^pX_{ij}\beta_j\Big)^2,\qquad\qquad\qquad\text{OLS}
\end{empheq}
which is minimized when
\begin{equation}
\bs{\beta}=(\bs{X}^T\bs{X})^{-1}\bs{X}^T\bs{y}.
\label{eq:ols}
\end{equation}

To solve this equation, we need to find the inverse of the matrix $\bs{X}^T\bs{X}$, which is typically done by \textit{lower-upper} decomposition (LU) or \textit{singular values decomposition} (SVD). Quite often when we deal with large data sets, the matrix above is singular, which means that the determinant of the matrix is zero. In those cases, we cannot find the inverse, and LU decomposition does not work. Fortunately, SVD \textit{always} works, and in cases where the matrix is singular, it turns out to be a good idea.

\subsubsection{Singular value decomposition}
Singular value decomposition is a method which decomposes a matrix into a product of three matrices, written as
\begin{equation}
\bs{X}=\bs{U}\bs{\Sigma}\bs{V}^T.
\end{equation}
This might sounds like a bad idea, but especially for singular matrices this often makes life easier. The reason for this, is that only $\Sigma$ is singular after the decomposition. For our case, we can thus write the matrix $\bs{X}^T\bs{X}$ as 
\begin{equation}
\bs{X}^T\bs{X}=\bs{V}\bs{\Sigma}^T\bs{\Sigma}\bs{V}^T=\bs{V}\bs{D}\bs{V}^T
\end{equation}
which is non-singular. By multiplying with $\bs{V}$ on the right-hand-side, we obtain 
\begin{equation}
(\bs{X}^T\bs{X})\bs{V}=\bs{V}\bs{D}
\end{equation}
and similarly
\begin{equation}
(\bs{X}\bs{X}^T)\bs{U}=\bs{U}\bs{D}
\end{equation}
when transposing the matrix. Using those expressions, one can show that
\begin{equation}
\bs{X}\bs{\beta}=\bs{U}\bs{U}^T\bs{y}.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Ridge regression}
So, how can we avoid non-singular values in our matrix $\bs{X}^T\bs{X}$? We can remove them by introduce a penalty $\lambda$ to ensure that all the diagonal values are non-zero, which can be accomplished by adding a small value to all diagonal elements. Doing this, all diagonal elements will get a non-zero value and the matrix is guaranteed to be non-singular. Still using the matrix-vector form, this can be written as 
\begin{equation}
\bs{\beta}=(\bs{X}^T\bs{X}+\lambda\bs{I})^{-1}\bs{X}^T\bs{y}
\end{equation}
where $\bs{I}$ is the identity matrix. The penalty $\lambda$ is also a \textit{hyper parameter}, which is a parameter that is set before the training begins, in contrast to the estimators which are determined throughout training. This method is called Ridge regression, and has a cost function given by 
\begin{empheq}[box={\mybluebox[5pt]}]{equation}
	\mathcal{C}(\bs{\beta})=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\Big(y_i-\sum_{j=0}^pX_{ij}\beta_j\Big)^2+\lambda\sum_{j=1}^p|\beta_j|^2\qquad\text{Ridge}
\end{empheq}
where we in principle just add the L2-norm of the estimator vector to the OLS cost function. This can easiest be proven going from the cost function to the matrix-vector expression of $\bs{\beta}$, as we did for ordinary least squares.

\subsubsection{LASSO regression}
Finally, we introduce the \textit{least absolute shrinkage and selection operator} (LASSO) regression, which in the same way as Ridge regression is based on a regularization. Instead of adding the L2-norm of the estimator matrix, we add the the L1-norm $|\beta_j|$, and the cost function expresses
\begin{empheq}[box={\mybluebox[5pt]}]{equation}
	\mathcal{C}(\bs{\beta})=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\Big(y_i-\sum_{j=0}^pX_{ij}\beta_j\Big)^2+\lambda\sum_{j=1}^p|\beta_j|.\qquad\text{Lasso}
\end{empheq}
For LASSO regression, there is no closed-form expressions for the estimators, which means that we need to use an iterative optimization algorithm in order to obtain the optimal estimators. Such optimization methods are essential in fields   will later be used in the variational Monte-Carlo sampling, and some methods are therefore detailed in chapter \eqref{chp:optimization}. 

However, to illustrate how this procedure goes on, we will explain how an arbitrary cost function consisting of estimators $\beta_j$ can be minimized by the simplest optimization algorithm: \textbf{gradient descent},
\begin{equation}
\beta_j^+=\beta_j-\eta \frac{\partial\mathcal{C}(\bs{\beta})}{\partial\beta_j},
\end{equation}
where $\beta_j^+$ is the updated version of $\beta_j$  Here we again are introduced to a hyperparameter $\eta$, known as the \textit{learning rate}, which controls how much the estimators should be changed for each iteration. This should be set carefully, where a too large $\eta$ will make the cost function diverge and a too small $\eta$ will make the training too slow. Typically, the $\eta$ is 0.01-0.0001. For ordinary least squares, the parameter update cna be written as
\begin{equation}
\bs{\beta}=\bs{\beta}^+-\eta\bs{X}^T(\bs{y}-\bs{X}^T\bs{\beta})
\end{equation}

\subsection{Logistic regression}
Up to this point, we have discussed regression with continuous output. But what do we do if we want a discrete output, for example in form of classification? This is what logistic regression is about, and we will now show how the cost function is defined.

Consider a system that can have two possible energies $\varepsilon_0$ and $\varepsilon_1$. From elementary statistical mechanics, we have that the probability of finding the system in the first state is given by
\begin{align}
P(y_i=0)&=\frac{\exp(-\varepsilon_0/k_BT)}{\exp(-\varepsilon_0/k_BT)+\exp(-\varepsilon_1/k_BT)}\\
&=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-(\varepsilon_1-\varepsilon_0)/k_BT)}
\end{align}
which is the \textit{sigmoid function}, which in the most general form is given by
\begin{equation}
f(x)=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)}.
\end{equation}
The first denominator is known as the \textit{partition function},
\begin{equation}
Z=\sum_{i=0}^1\exp(-\varepsilon_i/k_BT)
\end{equation}
where $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant and $T$ is the system temperature. The probability of finding the system in the second state is given by
\begin{align}
P(y_i=1)&=1-P(y_i=0)\\
&=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-(\varepsilon_0-\varepsilon_1)/k_BT)}.
\end{align}

Notice that the only thing we need is the difference in energy between those two systems, not the energy itself. This is often the case in physics. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{tikz/singlelayer_perceptron.tex}
	\caption{Logistic regression model with $n$ inputs. Each input $x_i^j$ is multiplied with a weight $w_j$, and the contribution from all elements is summarized. The output is obtained after the sum is activated by an activation function.}
	\label{fig:single_perceptron}
\end{figure}

If we now assume that the difference in energy can be written as a function of the coordinates that specify the state $i$, $\bs{x}_i$ and a matrix of parameters, $\bs{w}$, known as the \textit{weights}, the difference can be written as
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_1-\varepsilon_0=\bs{x}_i^T\bs{w},
\end{equation}
which gives the probability
\begin{equation}
P(\bs{x}_i,y_i|\bs{w})=\big(f(\bs{x}_i^T\bs{w})\big)^{y_i}\big(1-f(\bs{x}_i^T\bs{w})\big)^{1-y_i}.
\end{equation}
given a set of parameters $\bs{w}$. If we have a set of states $\mathcal{D}=\{(\bs{x}_i,y_i)\}$, the joint probability is given by
\begin{equation}
P(\mathcal{D}|\bs{w})=\prod_{i=1}^n\big(f(\bs{x}_i^T\bs{w})\big)^{y_i}\big(1-f(\bs{x}_i^T\bs{w})\big)^{1-y_i}
\end{equation}
which is known as the \textit{likelihood}. The \textit{log-likelihood} function is simply the log of the likelihood, and is given by 
\begin{equation}
l(\bs{w})=\sum_{i=1}^ny_i\log f(\bs{x}_i^T\bs{w})+(1-y_i)\log(1-f(\bs{x}_i^T\bs{w})).
\end{equation}

As in linear regression, we want to kind a cost function which we can minimize in order to fit the model to the data set. Since the log-likelihood function is maximized where the highest probability is, a natural choice is to set
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{C}(\bs{w})=-l(\bs{w})=-\sum_{i=1}^ny_i\log f(\bs{x}_i^T\bs{w})+(1-y_i)\log(1-f(\bs{x}_i^T\bs{w})).
\end{equation}
which is known as the \textit{cross entropy}. To make things clearer, we will try to illustrate how this works. In figure (\ref{fig:single_perceptron}), we have a input set $\bs{x}_i$ where each element is multiplied with a parameter from $\bs{w}$ and summarized. This corresponds to the inner product $\bs{x}_i^T\bs{w}$. Further, the sum (or the inner product) \textit{activated} with an \textit{activation function}, which we here have assumed to be the sigmoid function. The output is then given by
\begin{eqnarray}
z_i=f(\bs{x}_i^T\bs{w}).
\end{eqnarray}
After the activation the output is sent into the cost function to calculate the cost. As before, the cost function is minimized in an iterative scheme, where for example gradient descent gives the weight update
\begin{empheq}[box={\mybluebox[5pt]}]{align}
\bs{w}^+= \bs{w} - \eta\bs{x}^T[f(\bs{x}^T\bs{w})-\bs{y}].
\end{empheq}
which is extremely similar to the estimator update for linear regression.

\iffalse
Consider first a classification problem with two possible outcomes, for example the ultimatum: will I pass or fail the exam? In that case an output node is sufficient, where 0 is pass, 1 is fail and an intermediate value gives the probability that I will fail. In order to map the output to a number between 0 and 1, we use an activation function.

But, how does the model know if I will pass or fail? In order to get any useful information from the perceptron, we need to train it first. In our case, one could for instance use data from other students as input, and train the model as long as we know if they passed or failed. 

Now, what if we want to predict the grade instead of just pass/fail? In that case, we need a class for each grade one can get. A popular choice is to use \textit{one hot encoding}, which fires 

The very first step is to calculate the initial outputs (forward phase), where the weights usually are set to small random numbers. Then the error is calculated, and the weights are updated to minimize the error (backward phase). So far so good.

\subsubsection{Forward phase}\label{sec:forward}
Let us look at it from a mathematical perspective, and calculate the net output. The net output seen from an output node is simply the sum of all the "arrows" that point towards the node, see figure (\ref{fig:single_perceptron}), where each "arrow" is given by the left-hand node multiplied with its respective weight. For example, the contribution from input node 2 to the output node follows from $X_2\cdot w_{2}$, and the total net output to the output $O$ is therefore
\begin{empheq}[box={\mybluebox[5pt]}]{equation}
	net = \sum_{i=1}^{I} x_i\cdot w_i + b\cdot 1.
	\label{eq:forward}
\end{empheq}
Just some notation remarks: $x_i$ is the value of input node $i$ and $w_{i}$ is the weight which connects input $i$ to the output. $b$ is the bias weight, which we will discuss later.

You might wonder why we talk about the net output all the time, do we have other outputs? If we look at the network mathematically, what we talk about as the net output should be our only output. Anyway, it turns out to be convenient mapping the net output to a final output using an activation function, which is explained further in section \ref{sec:sigmoid1}. The activation function, $f$, takes in the net output and gives the output, 
\begin{equation}
out = f(net).
\end{equation}
If not everything is clear right now, it is fine. We will discuss the most important concepts before we dive into the maths.

\subsubsection{BIAS}
As mentioned above, we use biases when calculating the outputs. The nodes, with value $B$, are called the bias nodes, and the weights, $b$, are called the bias weights. But why do we need those? 

Suppose we have two inputs of value zero, and one output which should not be zero (this could for instance be a NOR gate). Without the bias, we will not be able to get any other output than zero, and in fact the network would struggle to find the right weights even if the output had been zero. 

The bias value $B$ does not really matter since the network will adjust the bias weights with respect to it, and is usually set to 1 and ignored in the calculations. [2]

\subsubsection{Learning rate}
In principle, the weights could be updated without adding any learning rate ($\eta=1$), but this can in practice be problematic. It is easy to imagine that the outputs can be fluctuating around the targets without decreasing the error, which is not ideal, and a learning rate can be added to avoid this. The downside is that with a low learning rate the network needs more training to obtain the correct results (and it takes more time), so we need to find a balance. 

\subsubsection{Loss function}\label{sec:loss_function}
The loss function is what defines the error, and in logistic regression the cross-entropy function is a naturally choice. [3] It reads
\begin{empheq}[box={\mybluebox[5pt]}]{equation}
	c(\boldsymbol{W}) = -\sum_{i=1}^n\Big[y_i\log f(\boldsymbol{x}_i^T\boldsymbol{W})+(1-y_i)\log[1-f(\boldsymbol{x}_i^T\boldsymbol{W})]\Big]
	\label{eq:cross_entropy}
\end{empheq}
where $\bs{W}$ contains all weights, included the bias weight ($\bs{W}\equiv[b,\bs{W}]$), and similarly does $\bs{x}$ include the bias node, which is 1; $\bs{x}\equiv[1,\bs{x}]$. Further, the $f(x)$ is the activation function discussed in next section.

The cross-entropy function is derived from likelyhood function, which famously reads
\begin{equation}
p(y|x)=\hat{y}^y\cdot(1-\hat{y})^{1-y}.
\end{equation}
Working in the log space, we can define a log likelyhood function
\begin{align}
	\log\Big[p(y|x)\Big]&=\log\Big[\hat{y}^y\cdot(1-\hat{y})^{1-y}\Big]\\
	&=y\log\hat{y}+(1-y)\log(1-\hat{y})
\end{align}
which gives the log of the probability of obtaining $y$ given $x$. We want this quantity to increase then the loss function is decreased, so we define our loss function as the negative log likelyhood function. [7]

Additionally, including a regularization parameter $\lambda$ inspired by Ridge regression is often convenient, such that the loss function is
\begin{equation}
c(\bs{W})^+=c(\bs{W})+\lambda||\bs{W}||_2^2.
\end{equation}
We will later study how this regularization affects the classification accuracy. 

\subsubsection{Activation function}\label{sec:sigmoid1}
Above, we were talking about the activation function, which is used to activate the net output. In binary models, this is often just a step function firing when the net output is above a threshold. For continuous outputs, the logistic function given by
\begin{empheq}[box={\mybluebox[5pt]}]{equation}
	f(x)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}.
	\label{eq:logistic}
\end{empheq}
is usually used in logistic regression to return a probability instead of a binary value. This function has a simple derivative, which is advantageous when calculating a large number of derivatives. As shown in section \ref{sec:sigmoid_der}, the derivative is simply
\begin{equation}
\frac{df(x)}{dx}=x(1-x).
\label{eq:logistic_der}
\end{equation}

$tanh(x)$ is another popular activation function in logistic regression, which more or less holds the same properties as the logistic function. 

\subsubsection{Backward phase}
Now all the tools for finding the outputs are in place, and we can calculate the error. If the outputs are larger than the targets (which are the exact results), the weights need to be reduced, and if the error is large the weights need to be adjusted a lot. The weight adjustment can be done by any minimization method, and we will look at a couple of gradient methods. To illustrate the point, we will stick to the \textbf{gradient descent} (GD) method in the calculations, even though other methods will be used later. The principle of GD is easy: each weight is "moved" in the direction of steepest slope,
\begin{empheq}[box={\mybluebox[5pt]}]{equation}
	\bs{w}^+= \bs{w} - \eta\cdot\frac{\partial c(\boldsymbol{w})}{\partial \bs{w}},
	\label{eq:w_update}
\end{empheq}
where $\eta$ is the learning rate and $c(\bs{w})$ is the loss function. We use the chain rule to simplify the derivative
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial c(\bs{w})}{\partial \bs{w}} =\frac{\partial c(\bs{w})}{\partial out} \cdot\frac{\partial out}{\partial net} \cdot\frac{\partial net}{\partial \bs{w}}
\end{equation}
where the first is the derivative of the loss function with respect to the output. For the cross-entropy function, this is
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial c(\bs{w})}{\partial out}=-\frac{y}{out}+\frac{1-y}{1-out}.
\end{equation}
Further, the second derivative is the derivative of the activation function with respect to the output, which is given in \eqref{eq:logistic_der}
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial out}{\partial net}=out(1-out).
\end{equation}
The latter derivative is the derivative of the net output with respect to the weights, which is simply
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial net}{\partial \bs{w}}=\bs{x}.
\end{equation}

If we now recall that $out=f(\bs{x}^T\bs{w})$, we can write 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial c(\bs{w})}{\partial \bs{w}}=[f(\bs{x}^T\bs{w})-\bs{y}]\bs{x}
\end{equation}
and obtain a weight update algorithm
\begin{empheq}[box={\mybluebox[5pt]}]{align}
	\bs{w}^+= \bs{w} - \eta\cdot[f(\bs{x}^T\bs{w})-\bs{y}]^T\bs{x}.
\end{empheq}
where the bias weight is included implicitly in $\bs{w}$ and the same applies for $\bs{x}$.
\fi

\subsection{Neural networks} \label{sec:neural_network}
Now we know enough to dive into the field of artificial neural networks. Neural networks can given either continuous or discrete outputs, and is therefore a competitor to both linear and logistic regression. The big strength of neural networks is that one can add multiple \textit{layers}, which potentially makes the model extremely flexible. According to \textbf{the universal approximation theorem}, a neural network with only one hidden layer can approximate any continuous function. [8] However, often multiple layers are used since this tends to give fewer nodes in total, and is known to give better results. Neural networks of more than one layer are called \textit{deep} networks, and as more layers are added the network gets \textit{deeper}.

In figure \eqref{fig:neural_network}, a two-layer neural network (one hidden layer) is illustrated. It has some similarities with the logistic regression model in figure \eqref{fig:single_perceptron}, but a hidden layer and multiple outputs are added. We have also dropped the representation of the weights, but each line corresponds to a weight. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{tikz/multilayer_perceptron.tex}
	\caption{Neural network with 3 input nodes, 5 hidden nodes and 2 output nodes, in addition to the bias nodes.}
	\label{fig:neural_network}
\end{figure}

Without a hidden layer, we have seen that the update of weights is quite straight forward. For a neural network consisting of multiple layers, the question is: how do we update the weights when we do not know the values of the hidden nodes? And how do we know which layer causing the error? This will be explained in section \ref{sec:backward}, where the most popular technique for that is discussed. Before that, we will generalize the forward phase presented in logistic regression.

\subsubsection{Forward phase}
In the previous section, we saw how the output is found for a single perceptron. For a neural network, the net output to the first layer is similar, and given by
\begin{equation}
y_j^{(1)}=\sum_{i=1}^nx_iw_{ij}^{(1)}=\bs{x}^T\bs{w}_j^{(1)}
\end{equation}
which gives the real output
\begin{equation}
z_j^{(1)}=f(y_j^1)=f(\bs{x}^T\bs{w}_j^{(1)}).
\end{equation}
This is then again the input to the next layer, so the output from the second layer is simply
\begin{equation}
z_j^{(2)}=f\big((\bs{z}^{(1)})^T\bs{w}_j^{(2)}\big).
\end{equation}
This connection between layer $l$ and $l-1$ applies for all the layers, so the general relation reads
\begin{equation}
z_j^{(l)}=f\big((\bs{z}^{(l-1)})^T\bs{w}_j^{(l)}\big),
\end{equation}
although the first outputs $\bs{z}^{(0)}$ is the dataset $\bs{x}$.

\subsubsection{Activation function}
Until now, we have mentioned the sigmoid function as the only activation function. However, there are plenty of other activation functions that one can use. In fact, the sigmoid function lost its popularity, and is today superseded by the more modern functions based on \textit{rectified Linear Units} (ReLU). Some popular choices are the \textit{leaky} ReLU and \textit{exponential Linear Unit} (ELU), which are linear for positive numbers. Pure linear activation functions are still widely used, especially on the output layer. 

In figure (\ref{fig:activation_functions}), standard RELU, leaky RELU and ELU are plotted along with the sigmoid function.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\subfloat[Sigmoid]{{\includegraphics[width=8cm]{Images/sigmoid.png} }}
	\subfloat[ReLU]{{\includegraphics[width=8cm]{Images/ReLU.png} }}\\
	
	\subfloat[Leaky ReLU]{{\includegraphics[width=8cm]{Images/LeakyReLU.png} }}%
	\subfloat[ELU]{{\includegraphics[width=8cm]{Images/ELU.png} }}
	\caption{Some well-known activation functions. The sigmoid function stands out from the others since it maps between 0 and 1, and it is not linear for positive numbers.}%
	\label{fig:activation_functions}%
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Backward propagation} \label{sec:backward}
Backward propagation is probably the most used technique for updating the weights in a neural network, and is actually again based on the parameter update presented for linear and logistic regression. It is called backward propagation because we are propagating from the outputs to the inputs.  

What differs, is the differentiation of the net input with respect to the weight, which gets more complex as we add more layers. For one hidden layer, we have two sets of weights, where the last layer is updated in a similar way as for a network without hidden layer, but the inputs are replaced with the values of the hidden nodes:
\begin{empheq}[box={\mybluebox[5pt]}]{align}
	w_{ij}^{(2)+}= w_{ij}^{(2)} - \eta\cdot[f(h_i^Tw_{ij})-y_j]^Th_i.
\end{empheq}
We recognize the first part as $\delta_{ok}$, such that
\begin{empheq}[box={\mybluebox[5pt]}]{equation}
	w_{ij}^{(1)+} = w_{ij}^{(1)} - \eta\cdot\sum_{k=1}^{O}\delta_{ok}\cdot w_{jk}^{(2)}\cdot f'(out_{hj})\cdot x_i
\end{empheq}
where we recall $\delta_{ok}$ as
\begin{equation*}
	\delta_{ok}=-(t_{ok}-out_{ok})\cdot f'(out_{ok}).
\end{equation*}
For more layers, the procedure is the same, but we keep on inserting the obtained outputs from various layers.

\subsubsection{Summary}
Since it will be quite a lot calculations, I will just express the results here, and move the calculations to Appendix B. The forward phase in a three-layer perceptron is
\begin{empheq}[box={\mybluebox[5pt]}]{align}
	net_{hi}&=\sum_jw_{ji}^{(1)}\cdot x_j\notag\\
	out_{hi}&=\text{f}(net_{hi})\notag\\
	\notag\\
	net_{ki}&=\sum_jw_{ji}^{(2)}\cdot out_{hj}\\
	out_{ki}&=\text{f}(net_{ki})\notag\\
	\notag\\
	net_{oi}&=\sum_jw_{ji}^{(3)}\cdot out_{kj}\notag\\
	out_{oi}&=\text{f}(net_{oi})\notag
\end{empheq}
which can easily be turned into vector form. The backward propagation follows from the two-layer example, and we get
\begin{empheq}[box={\mybluebox[5pt]}]{align}
	w_{ij}^{(3)}&=w_{ij}^{(3)}-\eta\cdot\delta_{oj}\cdot out_{ki}\notag\\
	\notag\\
	w_{ij}^{(2)}&=w_{ij}^{(2)}-\eta\sum_{k=1}^O\delta_{ok}\cdot w_{jk}^{(3)}\cdot f'(out_{kj})\cdot out_{hi}\notag\\
	\notag\\
	w_{ij}^{(1)}&=w_{ij}^{(1)}-\eta\sum_{k=1}^O\sum_{l=1}^K\delta_{ok}\cdot w_{lk}^{(3)}\cdot f'(out_{kl})\cdot w_{jl}^{(2)}f'(out_{hj})\cdot x_i\notag
\end{empheq}
where we again use the short hand 
\begin{equation*}
	\delta_{oj}=(t_j-out_{oj})\cdot f'(out_{oj}).
\end{equation*}
If we compare with the weight update formulas for the two-layer case, we recognize some obvious connections, and it is easy to imagine how we can construct a general weight update algorithm, no matter how many layers we have. 

Now over to the problem we want to solve using neural networks.


\section{Unsupervised Learning}
In unsupervised learning, a neural network is given the inputs only, and does not know what the output should look like. The task is then to find structures in the data, comparing data sets to each other and categorize the data sets with respect to their similarities and differences. 

We have previously seen how the parameters can be adjusted using the backward propagation algorithm, but it does not work when we do not have prior known targets. Instead, we need to rely on a set of probabilities, and we therefore need to look carefully at the statistical foundation before we move on to the unsupervised algorithms.

\subsection{Statistical foundation}
In this section, we will explain the general relation between the joint probability distribution of two variables $x$ and $y$, the marginal distributions and the conditional distributions. The expressions can either be set up with respect to the continuous space or the discrete space, and we will do the latter since we in practice will deal with discrete data sets. 

The joint probability of measure both $x$ and $y$ is given by
\begin{equation}
p(x,y)=p(x|y)p(y)=p(y|x)p(x)
\label{eq:jointprob}
\end{equation}
where $p(x|y)$ and $p(y|x)$ are the conditional distributions of $x$ and $y$ respectively. $p(x)$ and $p(y)$ are called the marginal probabilities for $x$ and $y$, and by reordering equation \eqref{eq:jointprob}, we obtain Bayes' theorem
\begin{equation}
p(x|y)=\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}
\end{equation}
where $p(x)$ is the \textit{prior} probability, $p(y|x)$ is the \textit{likelyhood} function and $p(x|y)$ is the \textit{posterior} probability. $p(y)$ can sometimes be found by a sum over the joint probability,
\begin{equation}
p(y)=\sum_i p(x_i,y) = \sum_i p(y|x_i)p(x_i),
\end{equation}
but often this summation is intractable. Different techniques require different approaches to this problem, and for our case we will use Markov chain Monte-Carlo methods to bypass it. More about that in section \eqref{chp:methods}. 

For supervised learning, the 
The parameters will always be updated such that the probability is maximized. For instance, 

Next challenge is that we do not have the posterior

Kullback-Leibler divergence gives a measure of how much information is loss when one goes from one probability distribution to another. 

\subsubsection{Marginal Distributions}

\subsubsection{Conditional Distributions}

\subsection{Boltzmann Machines}
Boltzmann Machines are based on the more primitive Hopfield network, where a system of nodes is set up which defines the system energy. Inspired by statistical mechanics, the probability of finding the system in a state of energy $E$ is given by the Boltzmann distribution,
\begin{equation}
P(\bs{s})=\frac{1}{Z}\exp(-E(\bs{s})/k_BT),
\label{eq:boltzmanndist}
\end{equation}
hence the name Boltzmann machines.  $\bs{s}$ includes all the nodes, $k_B$ is known as Boltzmann's constant and $T$ is the system temperature, but henceforth they both will be omitted by scaling $E'(\bs{s})=E(\bs{s})/k_BT$. $Z$ is known as the partition function, which is the sum over all possible probabilities.

In the most general form, all nodes are connected to all other nodes, that is an unrestricted Boltzmann machine, see figure \eqref{fig:boltzmann_machine} for an illustration. 

\input{tikz/boltzmann_machine.tex}

In the same manner as for a feed-forward neural network, we can directly multiply each node $s_i$ with all its respective inner weights $w_{ij}$ and then with the other nodes $s_j$. To obtain the total system energy, we also need to include the bias weights, i.e, multiply $s_i$ with $b_i$. This gives the energy
\begin{equation}
E(\bs{s})=- \sum_{i=1}^Ns_ib_i-\sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{j=i}^N s_iw_{ij}s_j 
\label{eq:unrestrictedboltzmannmachine}
\end{equation}
for a system of $N$ nodes, which is the so-called binary-binary network and the most basic architecture. During training, the weights are adjusted in order to maximize the probability...

\subsection{Restricted Boltzmann Machines}
When there is an unrestricted guy, a restricted guy must exist as well. What the term restricted means in this case, is that we ignore all the connections between nodes in the same layer, and keep only the inter-layer ones. In the same manner as in equation \eqref{eq:unrestrictedboltzmannmachine}, we can look at the linear case, where each node is multiplied with the corresponding weight, but now we need to distinguish between a visible node $x_i$ and a hidden node $h_j$. For the same reason, all the bias weights need to divided into a group connected to the visible nodes, $a_i$ and a group connected to the hidden nodes, $b_j$. The system energy then reads
\begin{equation}
E(\bs{x},\bs{h})=- \sum_{i=1}^Fx_ia_i- \sum_{j=1}^Hh_jb_j-\sum_{i=1}^F\sum_{j=i}^H x_iw_{ij}h_j 
\label{eq:binarybinary}
\end{equation}
which is called binary-binary units or Bernoulli-Bernoulli units. $F$ is the number of visible nodes and $H$ is number of hidden nodes. In figure \eqref{fig:restricted_boltzmann_machine}, a restricted Boltzmann machine with three visible nodes and three hidden nodes is illustrated.

\begin{figure} [H]
	\centering
	\input{tikz/restricted_boltzmann_machine.tex}
	\caption{Restricted Boltzmann machine. Black lines are the inter-layer connections, where for instance the line between $x_1$ and $h_1$ is related to the weight $w_{11}$. The blue lines are related to the input bias weights, and, for instance, the line going from the bias node to $x_3$ is called $a_3$. Similarly, the green lines are connections between the hidden nodes and the bias, and, for instance, the line going from the bias node to $h_3$ is called $b_3$.}
	\label{fig:restricted_boltzmann_machine}
\end{figure}

Until now we have discussed the linear models only, but as for feed-forward neural networks, we need non-linear models to solve non-linear problems. A natural next step is the Gaussian-binary units, which has a Gaussian mapping between the visible node bias and the visible nodes. The simplest such structure gives the following system energy:

\begin{equation}
E(\bs{x},\bs{h})= \sum_{i=1}^F\frac{(x_i-a_i)^2}{2\sigma_i^2} - \sum_{j=1}^Hh_jb_j-\sum_{i=1}^F\sum_{j=i}^H \frac{x_iw_{ij}h_j}{\sigma_i^2} 
\label{eq:gaussianbinary}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_i$ is the width of the Gaussian distribution, which can be set to an arbitrary number. Inserting the energy expression into equation \eqref{eq:boltzmanndist}, we obtain the general expression 
\begin{equation}
P(\bs{x},\bs{h})=\exp\Big(-\sum_{i=1}^F\frac{(x_i-a_i)^2}{2\sigma^2}\Big)\prod_{j=1}^H\exp\Big(h_jb_j+\sum_{i=1}^F\frac{h_jw_{ij}x_i}{\sigma^2}\Big).
\label{eq:RBMWF1}
\end{equation}
which is the Gaussian-binary joint probability distribution. Generative sampling algorithms, as Gibbs' sampling, use this distribution directly, while other sampling tools, as Metropolis sampling, need the marginal distribution. Since the hidden nodes are binary, we just need to sum the joint probability distribution over $h=0$ and $h=1$ to find the marginal distributions. We obtain the expression
\begin{equation}
P(\bs{x})=\exp\Big(-\sum_{i=1}^F\frac{(x_i-a_i)^2}{2\sigma^2}\Big)\prod_{j=1}^H\bigg(1+\exp\Big(b_j+\sum_{i=1}^F\frac{w_{ij}x_i}{\sigma^2}\Big)\bigg).
\label{eq:RBMWF2}
\end{equation}

Similarly, the marginal distribution of the hidden nodes 

More about the different sampling tools can be found in chapter \ref{chp:systems}.

\subsection{Partly Restricted Boltzmann Machines}
One can also imagine a partly restricted architecture, where we have connections inwards the visible nodes, but not the hidden nodes. This is what we have decided to call a partly restricted Boltzmann machine. A such neural network with three visible nodes and three hidden nodes is illustrated in figure \eqref{fig:partly_restricted_boltzmann_machine}.

\begin{figure} [H]
	\centering
	\input{tikz/partly_restricted_boltzmann_machine.tex}
	\caption{Partly restricted Boltzmann machine. Black lines are inter-layer connections, where for instance the line between $x_1$ and $h_1$ is related to the weight $w_{11}$. The blue lines are related to the input bias weights, and, for instance, the line going from the bias node to $x_3$ is related to $a_3$. Similarly, the green lines are related to the hidden nodes bias weights, and, for instance, the line going from the bias node to $h_3$ is related to $b_3$. Finally, the red lines are the intra-layer connections related to the intra-layer weights. The weight between node $x_1$ and $x_2$ is called $c_{12}$. }
	\label{fig:partly_restricted_boltzmann_machine}
\end{figure}

Compared to a standard restricted Boltzmann machine, we get an extra term in the energy expression where the visible nodes are connected. It is easy to find that the expression should be

\begin{equation}
E(\bs{x},\bs{h})= \sum_{i=1}^F\frac{(x_i-a_i)^2}{2\sigma_i^2} - \sum_{i=1}^F\sum_{j>i}^Fx_ic_{ij}x_j- \sum_{j=1}^Hh_jb_j-\sum_{i=1}^F\sum_{j=i}^H \frac{x_iw_{ij}h_j}{\sigma_i^2} 
\label{eq:partlygaussianbinary}
\end{equation}
with $c_{ij}$ as the weights between the visible nodes. For the later calculations, we are interested in the marginal distribution only, which reads

\begin{equation}
p(\bs{x})=\exp\Big(-\sum_{i=1}^F\frac{(x_i-a_i)^2}{2\sigma^2}+\sum_{i=1}^F\sum_{j>i}^Fx_ic_{ij}x_j\Big)\prod_{j=1}^H\bigg(1+\exp\Big(b_j+\sum_{i=1}^F\frac{w_{ij}x_i}{\sigma^2}\Big)\bigg).
\label{eq:PRBMWF}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Deep Boltzmann Machines}
We can also construct deep Boltzmann machines, where we just stack single-layer Boltzmann machines. There are many ways to construct those networks, where the number of layers, unit types, number of nodes and the degree of restriction can be chosen as the constructor wants. The number of combinations is endless, but in order to make use of the dept, all the layer should have different configurations. Otherwise, the deep network can be reduced to a shallower network. In figure \eqref{fig:deep_restricted_boltzmann_machine} a restricted Boltzmann machine of two hidden layers is illustrated. We have chosen three hidden nodes in each layer, and three visible nodes. It should be trivial to imagine how the network can be expanded to more layers. 
\begin{figure} [H]
	\centering
	\input{tikz/deep_boltzmann_machine.tex}
	\caption{Deep restricted Boltzmann machine. Black lines the inter-layer connections, where for instance the line between $x_1$ and $h_1$ is related to the weight $w_{11}$. The blue lines are related to the input bias weights, and, for instance, the line going from the bias node to $x_3$ is related to $a_3$. Similarly, the green lines are related to the hidden nodes bias weights, and, for instance, the line going from the bias node to $h_3$ is related to $b_3$.}
	\label{fig:deep_restricted_boltzmann_machine}
\end{figure}

As the main focus so far has been restricted Boltzmann machines, also the deep networks will be assumed to be restricted, although both partly restricted and unrestricted can be constructed. The system energy of a deep restricted Boltzmann machine of $L$ layers can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
E(\bs{x},\bs{h})= \sum_{i=1}^F\frac{(x_i-a_i)^2}{2\sigma_i^2} - \sum_{l=1}^L\sum_{j=1}^Hh_j^lb_j^l-\sum_{l=1}^L\sum_{i=1}^F\sum_{j=i}^H \frac{x_iw_{ij}^lh_j^l}{\sigma_i^2}
\label{eq:deepgaussianbinary}
\end{equation}
which gives the marginal probability distribution
\begin{equation}
p(\bs{x})=\exp\Big(-\sum_{i=1}^F\frac{(x_i-a_i)^2}{2\sigma^2}\Big)\prod_{l=1}^L\prod_{j=1}^H\bigg(1+\exp\Big(b_j^l+\sum_{i=1}^F\frac{w_{ij}^lx_i}{\sigma^2}\Big)\bigg).
\label{eq:DRBMWF}
\end{equation}
