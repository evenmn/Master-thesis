When defining a system, we also need to specify the basis set to be used. The single particle functions are often known, and they are well-suited as a basis for the total

\section{Quantum dots} \label{subsubsec:quantumdots}
Quantum dots are very small particles, and contain fermions or bosons hold together by an external potential. Since these particles have discrete electronic states like an atom, they are often called artificial atoms. 

In this thesis we will study electrons trapped in harmonic oscillators, where the external potential affecting particle $i$ is given by
\begin{equation}
u_i=\frac{1}{2}m\omega^2r_i^2.
\end{equation}
Using natural units as described in Appendix B, we can write the Hamiltonian as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:HOHamiltonian}
\hat{\mathcal{H}} = \sum_{i=1}^{P} \Big(-\frac{1}{2} \nabla_i^2 + \frac{1}{2} r_i ^2\Big) + \sum_{i<j} \frac{1}{r_{ij}} 
\end{equation}
where the energy is scaled with respect to atomic units and lengths are scaled with respect to the Bohr radius.

The exact solutions of the non-interacting Hamiltonian are the Hermite functions, 
\begin{equation}
f_n(x)=H_n(x)\exp(-x^2/2)
\end{equation}
which form our basis. $H_n(x)$ is the Hermite polynomial of $n$'th degree, and the first four Hermite functions are illustrated in figure \eqref{fig:harmonicoscillator}.

We will study closed-shell systems only, since the Slater determinant in that case is unambiguous. For open shells, the total Slater determinant is a linear combination of all the possible Slater determinants. The number of particles of closed-shell systems are called magic numbers, which in two dimensions are $N=2,6,12,\hdots$. In general, the magic numbers are given by
\begin{equation}
N=s\binom{n+d}{d}
\end{equation}
where $s$ is the number of spin configurations (2), $n$ is the principal quantum number and $d$ is the number of dimensions. This is a direct consequence of the Pauli principle, where we in the ground state can have two particles with radial wave functions $\Phi_{n_x=0,n_y=0}$, in the next energy level we have have 4 particles with radial wave functions $\Phi_{n_x=1,n_y=0}$ and $\Phi_{n_x=0,n_y=1}$ with degeneracy 2 and so on.

\section{Atomic systems} \label{subsubsec:atomic}
We will also investigate real atoms, where we freeze out the nucleonic degrees of freedom known as the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The electrons will in fact affect the nucleus, but due to the mass difference this effect will be negligible.

We again have Coulomb interaction between the electrons and the nucleus, and since we assume it to be at rest at the origin, the external potential affecting particle $i$ is
\begin{equation}
u_i=- \frac{1}{2} k\frac{Ze^2}{r_i},
\end{equation}
where $Z$ is the atomic number (number of protons in the nucleus). The total Hamiltonian is given in (Hartree) atomic units, 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:AtomicHamiltonian}
\hat{\mathcal{H}} = \sum_{i=1}^{P} \Big(-\frac{1}{2} \nabla_i^2 - \frac{1}{2} \frac{Z}{r_i}\Big) + \sum_{i<j} \frac{1}{r_{ij}},
\end{equation}
which also is discussed in Appendix B. 

HERE WE NEED TO WRITE ABOUT THE HYDROGEN-LIKE ORBITALS AND SPHERICAL HARMONICS

Again we will study closed shells only, but for atoms we will introduce subshells as well, which are dependent on the azimuthal quantum number $l$ in addition to the principal quantum number $n$. In general, we have that $l=\in [0,n-1]$ such that we only have one subshell for $n=1$. Traditionally, the first few subshells are denoted with $s, p, d$ and $f$, and the meaning can be found in table \eqref{tab:subshells}, together with number of electrons in each subshell.

\begin{table} [H]
	\caption{Table of the first subshells  \vspace{2mm}}
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{X|X:X:X} \hline\hline
		\label{tab:subshells}
		Subshell label & $l$ & Max electrons & Name \\ \hline
		$s$ & 0 & 2 & sharp\\ 
		$p$ & 1 & 6 & principal\\
		$d$ & 2 & 10 & diffuse \\
		$f$ & 3 & 14 & fundamental \\
		$g$ & 4 & 18 & alphabetic \\ \hline\hline
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

For Helium, we have two electrons with $n=1$, which means that both have $l=0$ and both electrons are in the $s$-subshell. We can thus write the electron configuration as $1s^2$. 

Similar as for $n$, we can use the tumble rule the lower $l$ the lower energy, such that for Beryllium all four electrons are still in the $s$-subshell. Beryllium therefore has electron configuration $1s^2 2s^2$ or [He] $2s^2$. Since both subshells are fully occupied, Beryllium can be included in our closed-shell calculations. 

If we continue with the same rules, we see that the next closed-shell atom has a fully occupied $p$-subshell as well, which is Neon with 10 electrons. This is a noble gas, and we can write the electron configuration as [Be] $2p^6$.

We can now compare this to the periodical system 

"Colloquially, we call such solutions and derived properties as electronic structure."
